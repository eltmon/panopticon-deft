# Panopticon Help

## Overview

Panopticon is a multi-agent orchestration framework for AI coding assistants. This skill provides a comprehensive overview of all available commands and capabilities.

## When to Use

- User asks about Panopticon capabilities
- User is confused about which command to use
- First-time users exploring the system
- User needs to discover available skills

## Core Concepts

**Workspace**: Isolated development environment for an issue (code + Docker containers + tmux session)
**Agent**: AI assistant running autonomously in a tmux session to work on an issue
**Skill**: Reusable guidance templates that AI assistants can invoke
**Tracker**: Issue tracking system (Linear, GitHub, GitLab)

pan init

# 2. Install prerequisites
pan install

# 3. Start services
pan up

# 4. Check health
pan doctor
```

### Working on an Issue
```bash
# 1. Optionally create a plan first
pan plan PAN-3

# 2. Create workspace and spawn agent
pan start PAN-3

# 3. Monitor agent status
pan status

# 4. Send message to agent if needed
pan tell PAN-3 "Run the tests"

# 5. When done, review and approve
pan review pending
pan approve PAN-3
```

### Managing Workspaces
```bash
# List all workspaces
pan workspace list

# Create workspace without agent
pan workspace create PAN-5

# Destroy workspace when done
pan workspace destroy PAN-5
```

## Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.panopticon.env` | Main configuration (API keys, tracker settings) |
| `~/.panopticon/skills/` | Skills distributed with Panopticon |
| `~/.panopticon/agents/` | Per-agent state and health |
| `~/.panopticon/workspaces/` | Workspace metadata |
| `~/.panopticon/backups/` | Configuration backups |

## Dashboard

The Panopticon dashboard provides a visual interface for:
- Kanban board with all issues from configured trackers
- Real-time agent monitoring (tmux session output)
- Agent control (send messages, stop agents)
- Workspace creation and management
- Activity log showing command output

Access the dashboard at: **http://localhost:3001** (after running `pan up`)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** `pan` command not found
**Solution:** Run `npm install -g` in the Panopticon directory, or add `./node_modules/.bin` to PATH

**Problem:** Dashboard won't start
**Solution:** Check ports 3001/3002 aren't in use, run `pan doctor` to verify dependencies

**Problem:** Agent appears stuck
**Solution:** Use `/session-health` skill, or `pan recover <id>`

**Problem:** Workspace containers won't start
**Solution:** Check Docker daemon is running, verify port conflicts with `pan workspace list`

**Problem:** Skills not syncing to Claude Code
**Solution:** Run `pan sync` manually, check `~/.claude/skills/` permissions

## Next Steps

- **New users**: Use `/pan-quickstart` skill for guided onboarding
- **Configuration**: Use `/pan-setup` skill to configure trackers and projects
- **Docker setup**: Use `/pan-docker` skill for Docker template configuration
- **Create your first workspace**: `pan start <your-issue-id>`
