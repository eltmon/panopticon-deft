# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- OpenAI model routing now requires Codex/ChatGPT subscription auth through CLIProxy; direct OpenAI API-key fallback is deprecated because api.openai.com is not Anthropic-compatible.
- Kimi models now launch through Claude Code directly, selecting the Kimi coding or Moonshot Anthropic endpoint from the configured key prefix.
- Z.AI / GLM models now launch through Claude Code directly against Z.AI's Anthropic-compatible endpoint.
- MiniMax models now launch through Claude Code directly against MiniMax's Anthropic-compatible endpoint.
- Mimo models now launch through Claude Code directly against Xiaomi MiMo's Anthropic-compatible endpoint.
- OpenRouter models now launch through Claude Code directly against OpenRouter's Anthropic-compatible endpoint while preserving slash-containing model IDs.
- `pan install`, `pan sync`, and lazy prerequisite checks no longer install or require `claudish`.
- Provider compatibility is now direct-only; claudish provider helpers and inspector badges have been removed.

## [0.7.0] — Command Taxonomy Reorganization

### Breaking Changes

The `pan` command surface has been reorganized around a five-bucket taxonomy.
All plumbing commands move under `pan admin`. Lifecycle commands lose the `pan work` prefix.
