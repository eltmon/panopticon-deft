VERIFICATION FAILED for PAN-647 (attempt 1/10):

Failed check: sync-target-branch

Sync with main FAILED — merge conflicts detected:
  - src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/MissionControl/index.tsx

## REQUIRED: Resolve merge conflicts with main BEFORE resubmitting

The target branch advanced since you started working. Your branch has merge conflicts that must be resolved.

1. Run: git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main
2. Resolve all conflicts in the listed files
3. Run the project's build and tests to verify nothing broke
4. Commit and push ALL changes
5. ONLY THEN resubmit:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/workspaces/PAN-647/request-review -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

Do NOT resubmit until all conflicts are resolved and tests pass.
