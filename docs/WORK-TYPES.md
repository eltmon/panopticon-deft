# Panopticon Work Types

Reference for the job settings Panopticon uses for model routing.

This document is about **routed work types and model-selection slots**, not the high-level roster of Panopticon runtime agents. Use [AGENT_TYPES_INDEX.md](./AGENT_TYPES_INDEX.md) if you want the newcomer-friendly map of what kinds of agents exist.

A work type is a routing slot for one kind of job inside the system. Some work types line up with runtime agents, some line up with helper jobs, and some line up with parallel review lanes or CLI contexts. They all matter for model selection, but they are **not** all members of the main Panopticon runtime agent roster.

Each work type is a routable job slot. You can override any of these IDs in `models.overrides` inside `~/.panopticon/config.yaml` or `.pan.yaml`.

## Overview

- Panopticon currently routes **23 router-backed work types**
- Work types are grouped by workflow role, not by provider
- Capability-based selection picks defaults automatically
- Overrides let you pin any one work type to any supported model

Example:

```yaml
models:
  overrides:
    issue-agent:implementation: gpt-5.4
    review:security: claude-opus-4-6
    cli:quick-command: claude-haiku-4-5
```

## Issue Agent Phases

These are the phases inside the main issue worker.

| Work type | When it runs | Typical default | Why you might override it |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `issue-agent:exploration` | First pass through the codebase, requirements, and surrounding context | `claude-opus-4-6` | Use Gemini for large-context scanning or Haiku for cheaper discovery |
| `issue-agent:implementation` | Main code-writing phase | `kimi-k2.5` | Use GPT-5.4 for premium coding or Sonnet for Anthropic-only shops |
| `issue-agent:testing` | Test loops, failing test repair, coverage work | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use GPT-5.4 Mini or GPT-5.4 if you prefer OpenAI for iterative fix loops |
| `issue-agent:documentation` | README updates, migrations, comments, supporting docs | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use Gemini or GPT if you want one provider across all issue-agent work |
| `issue-agent:review-response` | Follow-up fixes after review feedback | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use GPT-5.4 when review feedback tends to require code-heavy refactors |

### Guidance

- Override `issue-agent:implementation` first if you only care about one slot.
- Keep `issue-agent:exploration` on a high-context or high-reasoning model for unfamiliar codebases.
- Keep `issue-agent:testing` on a model that is fast enough for retry loops.

## Specialist Agents

These are dedicated long-running workflow stages.

| Work type | When it runs | Typical default | Why you might override it |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `specialist-review-agent` | Dedicated review pass before merge | `claude-opus-4-6` | Lower to Sonnet if you want to reduce cost on routine repos |
| `specialist-test-agent` | Dedicated test specialist pass | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to GPT-5.4 for harder debugging-heavy test suites |
| `specialist-merge-agent` | Merge prep, merge-time validation, conflict handling | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to Opus for very risky multi-repo or conflict-heavy workflows |
| `specialist-inspect-agent` | Per-bead inspection gate during implementation — opt-in via `metadata.requiresInspection: true` on the bead's plan item (PAN-382, revised 2026-05-08; see `docs/prds/planned/PAN-382-inspect-specialist.md`) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to Opus when spec fidelity is critical or diffs are complex |
| `specialist-uat-agent` | Browser-based user acceptance testing after tests pass | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to Opus for high-stakes UX validation or complex product flows |

### Guidance

- Keep review and merge on cautious models.
- If CI is noisy or flaky, upgrading `specialist-test-agent` can save time.

## Subagents

These are smaller helper jobs spawned for focused tasks.

| Work type | When it runs | Typical default | Why you might override it |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `subagent:explore` | Fast helper for reading/searching | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Use Gemini Flash or GPT-5.4 Nano for cheaper/faster helper work |
| `subagent:plan` | Helper for approach sketches and breakdowns | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Use Sonnet or Gemini Pro if these plans need more rigor |
| `subagent:bash` | Shell-heavy helper work | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Use GPT-5.4 Mini if your bash helpers also need better code reasoning |
| `subagent:general-purpose` | Mixed helper tasks that are not obviously one category | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use GPT-5.4 or Gemini Pro for richer multi-step side tasks |

### Guidance

- These are good slots for cheap models.
- If a helper starts writing substantial code, prefer `subagent:general-purpose` over the ultra-fast slots.

## Review Lanes

Review work types are routing slots for **parallel review lanes**, not additional members of the main runtime agent roster.

A parallel review fans out into multiple review lenses simultaneously, then combines those results into a final synthesis step. These entries matter because you can route each lane to a different model, but they should be understood as configuration slots inside the review system rather than standalone Panopticon runtime agents.

| Work type | When it runs | Typical default | Why you might override it |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `review:security` | Security-focused parallel review | `claude-opus-4-6` | Only lower this if you knowingly accept more review risk |
| `review:performance` | Performance-focused parallel review | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use Gemini Pro if you want cheaper algorithm and perf analysis |
| `review:correctness` | Logic and correctness review | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to Opus for bug-prone or safety-critical code |
| `review:requirements` | Requirement/design alignment review | capability-based | Pin Sonnet or Opus when requirement drift is a recurring issue |
| `review:synthesis` | Final combined summary of review findings | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to Opus when you want the most careful synthesis pass |

### Guidance

- Security and synthesis are the review slots most worth upgrading.
- Performance review is often a good place to save cost if you already trust your benchmark/test loop.
- If you are trying to understand the main Panopticon workflow, read review lane entries as model configuration slots, not as part of the core runtime agent inventory.

## Planning

The planning phase is separate from the issue-agent implementation loop.

| Work type | When it runs | Typical default | Why you might override it |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `planning-agent` | Up-front planning and vBRIEF generation | capability-based, usually `claude-opus-4-6` | Use Gemini Pro for cheaper large-context planning or GPT-5.4 for a more code-shaped planning style |
| `status-review` | Executive-style planning progress summaries in Mission Control | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Raise to Opus if you want deeper requirement-to-progress analysis |

### Guidance

- This is the slot to protect if architecture quality matters.
- Planning quality usually matters more than saving a small amount of cost here.

## CLI Modes

These control Panopticon’s direct user-facing CLI interactions.

| Work type | When it runs | Typical default | Why you might override it |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `cli:interactive` | Ongoing interactive CLI conversations | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use GPT-5.4 if you want OpenAI as the primary daily driver |
| `cli:quick-command` | Short one-shot commands and small utility requests | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Use GPT-5.4 Nano or Gemini Flash Lite if speed or cost matters more |

### Guidance

- `cli:interactive` should feel reliable and context-aware.
- `cli:quick-command` should feel fast.

## Common Override Patterns

### Premium implementation

```yaml
models:
  overrides:
    issue-agent:implementation: gpt-5.4
    issue-agent:testing: gpt-5.4-mini
```

### Anthropic-heavy reviews, cheaper helpers

```yaml
models:
  overrides:
    specialist-review-agent: claude-opus-4-6
    review:security: claude-opus-4-6
    subagent:explore: claude-haiku-4-5
    cli:quick-command: claude-haiku-4-5
```

### Kimi implementation lane

```yaml
models:
  overrides:
    issue-agent:implementation: kimi-k2.5
```

### Gemini planning lane

```yaml
models:
  overrides:
    planning-agent: gemini-3.1-pro-preview
    issue-agent:exploration: gemini-3-flash

  gemini_thinking_level: 4
```

## Choosing What to Override

If you want the smallest useful set of overrides:

1. Override `issue-agent:implementation`
2. Override `review:security`
3. Override `cli:quick-command`

That covers the three most noticeable user tradeoffs:

- coding quality
- review rigor
- day-to-day responsiveness
