# vBRIEF Plan Format & Lifecycle

Panopticon uses [vBRIEF v0.5](https://github.com/deftai/vBRIEF) for machine-readable work plans with a unified `.pan/` directory model (PAN-967).

## Specification

The canonical vBRIEF specification is maintained at **[github.com/deftai/vBRIEF](https://github.com/deftai/vBRIEF)**.

Panopticon's vBRIEF files conform to the v0.5 spec with metadata extensions for issue tracking and difficulty estimation. We also maintain a [fork of the spec](https://github.com/eltmon/vBRIEF) and have an open [extension proposal](https://github.com/deftai/vBRIEF/issues/1).

---

## Lifecycle Model

### Directory Structure

All Panopticon orchestration state lives under `.pan/` — a single dot-directory at the project root (same convention as `.git/`, `.github/`, `.beads/`).

#### On main (project root):

```
.pan/
  specs/
    2026-05-01-PAN-950-feature-x.vbrief.json     (status: "completed")
    2026-05-03-PAN-960-feature-y.vbrief.json     (status: "active")
    2026-05-05-PAN-969-directive-flow.vbrief.json (status: "proposed")
  drafts/
    PAN-970-next-thing.md                         (PRD being refined)
```

#### On feature branch (workspace):

```
.pan/
  continue.json             ← session state (resume point, decisions, hazards, statusOverrides)
  sessions.jsonl            ← append-only session history
  feedback/
    001-review-changes-requested.md
    002-test-failures.md
  context.md                ← FEATURE-CONTEXT for Rally story agents
```

### PRD → Spec Lifecycle

PRDs and vBRIEFs are distinct artifacts that flow through the same pipeline:

1. **PRD drafted** — human or planning agent writes a markdown PRD to `.pan/drafts/` on main
2. **Planning completes** — planning agent converts the PRD into a machine-readable vBRIEF spec in `.pan/specs/` with `status: "proposed"`
3. **Work starts** — `pan start` updates the spec's `status` field to `"active"` on main; work agents read it via `findPlan()` and track item progress in workspace `continue.json` `statusOverrides`
4. **Work completes** — after merge, `status` updated to `"completed"` on main

### Status Transitions (field-based)

Status is a JSON field inside the vBRIEF — files never move between directories. All transitions are single atomic commits on main.

```
draft ──► proposed ──► active ──► completed
                 │                    │
                 └──► cancelled ◄─────┘
```

| Transition | Trigger | What happens |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| (new) → draft | `pan plan` starts | PRD written to `.pan/drafts/` on main |
| draft → proposed | Planning completes | vBRIEF created in `.pan/specs/` with `status: "proposed"` |
| proposed → active | `pan start` | Status field updated to `"active"` on main; agents read spec from main via `findPlan()` |
| active → completed | PR merges | Status field updated to `"completed"` on main |
| active → cancelled | Issue closed | Status field updated to `"cancelled"` on main |

### Issue-Keyed Filenames

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<ISSUE-ID>-<slug>.vbrief.json`

Example: `2026-04-28-MIN-846-fizzy-master.vbrief.json`

| Component | Source | Immutable? |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) | UTC creation date | Yes — never changes |
| Issue ID | From `plan.id` (e.g. `PAN-946`, `MIN-846`) | Yes |
| Slug | `slugify(plan.title)` — lowercase, dashes, max readability | Yes |

The filename regex: `^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})-([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*-\d+)-([a-z0-9-]+)\.vbrief\.json$`

If `slugify()` receives an empty or all-special-character title, it returns `'plan'` as the slug.

### Workspace Spec (PAN-1124: single-spec-on-main)

There is no workspace-local copy of the spec. Work agents read the canonical spec directly from main's `.pan/specs/` via `findPlan()`. Item/subItem status updates are tracked in the workspace `continue.json`'s `statusOverrides` flat map. `readWorkspacePlan()` returns a merged view (main spec + overlay) so callers see a complete document with up-to-date statuses.

### Concurrency Model

| Resource | Writer | Readers | Contention |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| `.pan/specs/<file>` on main | Pipeline only | Dashboard, agents (via `findPlan()`) | None — single writer, immutable after planning |
| `.pan/continue.json` on branch | Pipeline + `updateItemStatus()` | Agent (injected into prompt at session start) | None — one agent per workspace |
| `.pan/sessions.jsonl` on branch | Pipeline appends | Dashboard, post-mortems | Minimal — append-only |
| `.pan/feedback/*.md` on branch | Pipeline only | Agent (injected into prompt) | None — single writer |
| Beads (`.beads/`) | Each agent via `bd update` | Pipeline, dashboard | Serialized by Dolt mutex |

For N parallel agents on N different issues: each has its own feature branch with its own `.pan/` directory. Zero cross-agent contention. Beads writes serialize through the Dolt mutex but target different bead IDs.

---

## Continue State — Structured Session History

The continue file is the machine-readable operational state for in-progress work. It lives on the feature branch at `.pan/continue.json`.

### Schema

```json

    ]
  }
}
```

## Field Reference

### Top-Level (vBRIEF standard)

#### `vBRIEFInfo` fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `vBRIEFInfo.version` | YES | Must be `"0.5"` |
| `vBRIEFInfo.created` | YES | ISO 8601 timestamp — when the document was created |
| `vBRIEFInfo.updated` | NO | ISO 8601 timestamp — updated automatically on every write |
| `vBRIEFInfo.author` | NO | Tool identifier, e.g. `"panopticon-cli/0.6.0"` |
| `vBRIEFInfo.description` | NO | Human-readable description: `"Plan for PAN-436: ..."` |

#### `plan` fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `plan.id` | YES | Issue ID in lowercase (e.g., `"pan-436"`) |
| `plan.title` | YES | Human-readable plan title |
| `plan.status` | YES | One of: `draft`, `proposed`, `approved`, `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `plan.items` | YES | Array of work items |
| `plan.edges` | NO | Dependency edges between items |
| `plan.uid` | NO | UUID v4, generated once at creation — stable identifier for the plan |
| `plan.author` | NO | Who created the plan, e.g. `"agent:claude-opus-4-6"` |
| `plan.sequence` | NO | Monotonically incrementing write counter (starts at 1, auto-incremented by io.ts) |
| `plan.references` | NO | External links — see [References](#references) |
| `plan.created` | NO | ISO 8601 timestamp — when the plan was first created |
| `plan.updated` | NO | ISO 8601 timestamp — updated automatically on every status write |
| `plan.tags` | NO | Tags for categorization |
| `plan.narratives` | NO | Problem/Proposal/Constraint/Risk narratives |

#### `plan.status` Enum

The `plan.status` field drives lifecycle transitions:

| Status | Location | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `draft` | `.pan/drafts/` (PRD stage) | Planning in progress |
| `proposed` | `.pan/specs/` | Planning done, awaiting approval |
| `approved` | `.pan/specs/` | User approved, ready to start |
| `pending` | `.pan/specs/` | Queued, waiting for resources |
| `running` | `.pan/specs/` | Agent is executing |
| `completed` | `.pan/specs/` | Work done, merged |
| `blocked` | `.pan/specs/` | Waiting on external dependency |
| `cancelled` | `.pan/specs/` | Abandoned |

#### References

`plan.references` is an array of `VBriefReference` objects:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `uri` | YES | URL or path to the referenced resource |
| `label` | NO | Human-readable label (e.g., `"PAN-436"`) |
| `type` | NO | Resource type: `"issue"`, `"prd"`, `"spec"`, `"doc"` |

### Items (vBRIEF standard)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | YES | Short kebab-case identifier |
| `title` | YES | Task title |
| `status` | YES | Same enum as plan.status |
| `priority` | NO | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `created` | NO | ISO 8601 timestamp — when the item was created |
| `completed` | NO | ISO 8601 timestamp — set automatically when status → `completed` |
| `narrative` | NO | `{ "Action": "what to do" }` |
| `subItems` | NO | Child items (used for acceptance criteria) |

### Edges (dependency graph)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `from` | YES | Source item ID |
| `to` | YES | Target item ID |
| `type` | YES | Edge type: `blocks`, `informs`, `invalidates`, `suggests` |

Edge semantics:
- `blocks` — `to` cannot start until `from` completes (hard dependency)
- `informs` — `to` should consider decisions from `from` (soft dependency)
- `invalidates` — `from` invalidates assumptions made by `to`
- `suggests` — `from` gives guidance to `to`

Only `blocks` edges are used for critical path computation and bead scheduling (`bd ready`).

### Panopticon Extensions (via `metadata`)

The vBRIEF spec supports arbitrary `metadata` on items and subItems. Panopticon uses these metadata fields:

| Field | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `metadata.difficulty` | items | `trivial`, `simple`, `medium`, `complex`, `expert` — used for model routing |
| `metadata.issueLabel` | items | Issue ID for beads label filtering (e.g., `"pan-436"`) |
| `metadata.kind` | subItems | `"acceptance_criterion"` — marks subItem as an AC for verification gate |
| `metadata.canonicalFilename` | plan | Preserves the immutable filename across re-finalizations |

These extensions are NOT part of the vBRIEF core spec. We've opened a feature request to standardize them: **[deftai/vBRIEF#1](https://github.com/deftai/vBRIEF/issues/1)**.

---

## `pan scope` Commands

Manual lifecycle transition overrides for vBRIEFs. All commands resolve the project from the issue ID and update the status field in `.pan/specs/` on main.

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `pan scope list` | Scan `.pan/specs/` across all projects, print issue ID / title / status |
| `pan scope show <issueId>` | Display title, status, sequence, file path, item count |
| `pan scope propose <issueId>` | Set `plan.status` to `proposed` |
| `pan scope approve <issueId>` | Set `plan.status` to `approved` |
| `pan scope complete <issueId>` | Set `plan.status` to `completed` |
| `pan scope cancel <issueId>` | Set `plan.status` to `cancelled` |
| `pan scope restore <issueId>` | Set `plan.status` to `approved` (from completed or cancelled) |

### Planned (PAN-958)

- `pan scope ingest` — Import an existing vBRIEF or PRD into the lifecycle as a `proposed` scope
- `pan scope reconcile` — Detect and fix state disagreements between vBRIEFs, tracker, and workspaces

---

## `pan sync` vBRIEF Disagreement Detection

`pan sync` detects state disagreements between the vBRIEF lifecycle, issue tracker, and workspace state:

| Check | Meaning | Suggested Fix |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Active vBRIEF but GitHub issue is closed | Work artifact out of sync with tracker | `pan scope complete <ID>` or `pan scope cancel <ID>` |
| Completed vBRIEF but workspace still exists | Stale workspace after merge | Clean up workspace |
| Workspace exists but no active vBRIEF | Missing lifecycle entry | `pan scope approve <ID>` |

---

## How Panopticon Uses vBRIEF

1. **PRD authored** — human or planning agent writes a PRD to `.pan/drafts/` on main.
2. **Planning agent** converts the PRD into a vBRIEF spec during the discovery session. Creates `plan.vbrief.json` in the workspace `.pan/` directory.
3. **`complete-planning`** promotes the vBRIEF to `.pan/specs/` on main with an issue-keyed filename and sets `plan.status` to `proposed`.
4. **`pan start`** updates `plan.status` to `active` on main. Work agents read the spec from main via `findPlan()`.
5. **Work agent** works through beads in DAG dependency order (`bd ready -l <issue>`). Item/subItem status updates are written to workspace `continue.json`'s `statusOverrides` map. `readWorkspacePlan()` returns a merged view with current statuses.
6. **Verification gate** checks all subItems with `metadata.kind: "acceptance_criterion"` are `completed` before allowing review.
7. **`postMergeLifecycle`** updates `plan.status` to `completed` in `.pan/specs/` on main.
8. **Dashboard** renders the plan via the Directive Flow (DAG visualization) and vBRIEF viewer (List/DAG/Raw JSON tabs).

### Plan Resolution (PAN-1124: single-spec-on-main)

`findPlan(workspacePath)` in `src/lib/vbrief/io.ts` now resolves the main-side spec first via `findSpecByIssue(projectRoot, issueId)`. It derives the issue ID from the workspace directory name (`feature-<id>`) and the project root (two levels up). Falls back to workspace-local `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` for migration compat with in-flight workspaces.

`readWorkspacePlan(workspacePath)` returns a merged view: main-side spec + `statusOverrides` from workspace `continue.json`. This is transparent to all callers.

`findVBriefByIssue(projectRoot, issueId)` in `lifecycle-io.ts` remains the canonical read-only lifecycle lookup for cross-issue queries.

### Backward Compatibility

`.planning/plan.vbrief.json` was retired in PAN-967. Workspace-local `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` was retired in PAN-1124 — existing workspace copies are still read as a fallback, but new workspaces do not receive a copy.

The legacy `vbrief/{proposed,active,completed,cancelled}/` lifecycle directories at the project root are still read by `findLegacyVBriefByIssue` so in-flight work from before the cutover keeps resolving. All writes target `.pan/specs/` only, and lifecycle status changes are atomic field flips on a single file — files do NOT move between directories.

Continue files on the main side live at `<projectRoot>/.pan/continues/<issue-lowercase>.vbrief.json`. Workspace-side continue state lives at `<workspace>/.pan/continue.json` and includes `statusOverrides` for item/subItem status tracking.

## Common Mistakes

**DO NOT** use flat format:
```json
// WRONG — missing vBRIEFInfo, plan wrapper
{
  "issue": "PAN-436",
  "items": [...]
}
```

**DO NOT** use variant field names for the issue ID:
```json
// WRONG — use plan.id, not these
{ "issue": "PAN-436" }
{ "issueId": "PAN-436" }
{ "issue_id": "PAN-436" }
```

**DO** use the canonical nested format:
```json
// CORRECT
{
  "vBRIEFInfo": { "version": "0.5", "created": "..." },
  "plan": { "id": "pan-436", ... }
}
```

---

## Resilience

The `readPlan()` function in `src/lib/vbrief/io.ts` normalizes flat format plans to the canonical nested format for backwards compatibility. The normalizer handles:

- `issue`, `issueId`, `issue_id`, `id` → `plan.id`
- `description` → `narrative.Action`
- `difficulty` → `metadata.difficulty`
- `acceptance[]` (string array) → `subItems[]` with `metadata.kind: "acceptance_criterion"`

---

## Divergence from deft

Panopticon adapts deft's lifecycle model for multi-agent, multi-issue orchestration:

| deft Constraint | Panopticon Divergence |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| One `plan.vbrief.json` per project | N concurrent vBRIEFs per project (one per issue) |
| Serialized changes | N agents on N issues in parallel, each in its own workspace |
| `history/changes/` folder structure | Issue-keyed filenames in `.pan/specs/` |
| Status = directory location | Status = JSON field (files never move) |
| `specification.vbrief.json` required | Optional (exists in repo but not enforced) |
| `playbook-{name}.vbrief.json` | Panopticon uses skills for this |

The vBRIEF format itself works without modification — it's the single-plan-per-project constraint that Panopticon relaxes.
