# Working on Issue: {{ISSUE_ID}}

**Workspace:** {{WORKSPACE_PATH}}

{{#MEMORY_CONTEXT}}
## Memory Context

{{MEMORY_CONTEXT}}
{{/MEMORY_CONTEXT}}

## CRITICAL: Stay In Your Workspace

**You MUST only operate within your workspace directory: `{{WORKSPACE_PATH}}`**

- NEVER `cd` to the parent project directory or any path outside your workspace
- NEVER run `git stash`, `git checkout`, or any destructive git commands outside your workspace
- **NEVER run history-rewriting git commands:** `git rebase -i`, `git commit --amend`, `git reset --hard`, `git squash`, or any operation that changes commit hashes. These are forbidden — they destroy review history and break the pipeline.
- **If `pan done` fails with rebase conflicts:** run `git merge main` (or `git merge origin/main`) and resolve the single merge conflict. Do NOT attempt to squash, rewrite, or rebase-interactively to avoid conflicts.
- Your workspace is a git worktree — it has its own branch and working tree independent of the main repo
- Running git commands in the parent repo will destroy other agents' uncommitted work
- If you need to check main branch state, use `git log origin/main` from within your workspace

{{#POLYREPO_CONTEXT}}
{{POLYREPO_CONTEXT}}
{{/POLYREPO_CONTEXT}}

## CRITICAL: Do NOT Self-Review

**NEVER perform code reviews yourself.** Panopticon has a dedicated review pipeline with specialist agents (correctness, security, performance, requirements) that runs automatically when you call `pan done`.

- Do NOT spawn `code-review-*` subagents via the Agent tool
- Do NOT read review prompt template files — those are for the review pipeline, not for you
- Do NOT run your own correctness/security/performance analysis before submitting
- When you receive review feedback, fix the specific issues listed and resubmit via `/rebase-and-submit` — do NOT re-review your own fixes

Your job is implementation. Reviews are handled by `pan done` → review specialist pipeline.

## IMPORTANT: Read Context Files First

{{#LOCAL}}
Before starting any work, you MUST read these files to understand the full context:

1. **Read `./.pan/continue.json`** - Structured planning context: decisions, hazards, and approach from the planning agent. Replaces the old STATE.md.
2. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** (in workspace) - Contains workspace-specific instructions and warnings.
3. **Read `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/CLAUDE.md`** - Contains project-wide development guidelines.
4. **Check `feedback[]` in the continue file** — If the continue file has a non-empty `feedback` array, each entry contains inline specialist feedback (review issues, test failures, merge blocks) requiring action. This is the primary feedback source (Layer 1+). The `SPECIALIST FEEDBACK` section below injects these entries for you.
   Also check `.pan/feedback/` for filesystem feedback entries when present.

These files contain critical context that may have been updated since the last session.
{{/LOCAL}}
{{#REMOTE}}
Your workspace is at /workspace. Check for planning artifacts under `/workspace/.pan/`:
- `/workspace/.pan/continue.json` — structured planning context (decisions, hazards, resumePoint)
- `/workspace/.pan/spec.vbrief.json` — workspace working copy of the vBRIEF plan
- `/workspace/.pan/drafts/<ISSUE-ID>.md` — PRD draft (markdown narrative), if planning produced one

Start by reading `.pan/continue.json` to understand the plan, then begin implementation.
If no continue file exists, check the issue tracker for requirements.
{{/REMOTE}}

## Playwright Isolation

- When you use Playwright MCP for browser verification, use an isolated browser instance/profile.
- Never rely on another agent's browser session, cookies, tabs, zoom level, or shared profile state.
- If you need authenticated/browser state, recreate it inside your own isolated session.
- If Playwright reports browser/profile contention, treat it as a tooling/config bug to fix — do not skip UI verification.

## CRITICAL: Never Approve Permission Prompts

- NEVER answer, approve, deny, dismiss, or drive a permission prompt by sending keystrokes to any Claude Code session.
- NEVER run `tmux send-keys`, `tmux paste-buffer`, `sendKeys`, `sendKeysAsync`, or any equivalent session-input mechanism to interact with a permission dialog.
- If a permission prompt appears in your own session, wait for the harness/user to handle it; if it appears in another agent, treat that as a system bug and fix the permissions path, not the prompt.
- Do not ask an inspector, reviewer, test agent, or any subagent to approve a prompt. Permission decisions belong to the harness/user path only.

{{#TLDR_AVAILABLE}}
## TLDR: Token-Efficient Code Analysis

**You have access to TLDR MCP tools for analyzing code without reading full files.**

This dramatically reduces token consumption and lets you understand codebases faster.

### Available TLDR Tools

- **`tldr_context <file>`** - Get file structure, exports, imports, key functions (500-1,200 tokens vs 10-25k for full read)
- **`tldr_structure <directory>`** - Understand directory layout and relationships
- **`tldr_calls <function> <file>`** - See what calls this function (call graph analysis)
- **`tldr_impact <function> <file>`** - See what this function calls (impact analysis)
- **`tldr_semantic <query>`** - Find code by natural language description

### When to Use TLDR

Use TLDR first for:
- Understanding file structure before editing
- Finding where a feature is implemented
- Understanding cross-file dependencies
- Exploring unfamiliar code
- Searching for code by description

Read full file when:
- You need to edit specific lines (TLDR gives context, then read to edit)
- Debugging syntax errors (need exact line content)
- Reviewing exact implementation details

### Example Workflow

```
1. Agent needs to understand auth.ts
   → tldr_context src/auth.ts                    # 1,200 tokens - see structure
   → Understand exports, imports, key functions
   → Only read full file if editing specific code

2. Agent needs to find where JWT is validated
   → tldr_semantic "JWT token validation"       # Find relevant files
   → tldr_context <matched-files>                # Understand each file
   → Read only the specific function to edit

3. Agent needs to understand impact of changing login()
   → tldr_impact login src/auth.ts              # See what login() calls
   → tldr_calls login src/auth.ts               # See what calls login()
   → Understand full dependency chain without reading all files
```

### Token Savings

- **Without TLDR:** Read 20 files × 15k tokens = 300k tokens (exhausts context)
- **With TLDR:** Analyze 20 files × 800 tokens = 16k tokens (94% reduction)

**Use TLDR liberally.** It's designed for this workflow and will dramatically extend how much work you can do per session.

## Beads Tasks

Tasks created during planning (check .pan/continue.json `sessionHistory` for which are complete):

{{BEADS_TASKS}}

### MANDATORY: One Bead At A Time

An automated **Inspect Specialist** runs in parallel with you. It verifies each bead's
implementation matches its specification. It needs a **scoped diff** — one bead per commit.
If you batch multiple beads, the inspector cannot verify them individually and your work
will be rejected.

**Workflow for EVERY bead:**
1. `bd ready -l {{ISSUE_ID_LOWER}}` — find the next unblocked bead for THIS issue
2. `bd update <bead-id> --claim` — claim it
3. Implement ONLY that bead's work
4. `git add` and `git commit` — one bead = one commit
5. **Update `.pan/continue.json`** — append a decision or hazard if you learned something new, update `resumePoint` with what the next agent should do (see continue format below)
6. `bd close <bead-id> --reason="what you did"`
7. **Re-read this bead's plan item metadata** in `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` after the commit and before deciding inspection:
   - If `metadata.requiresInspection === false`: skip inspection entirely and proceed straight to step 1.
   - If `metadata.requiresInspection === true`: read `metadata.inspectionDepth` (`fast` by default when omitted), then run the matching command and **WAIT** for the verdict (delivered via `pan tell`):
     - `inspectionDepth: "fast"` or omitted → `pan inspect {{ISSUE_ID}} --bead <bead-id>`
     - `inspectionDepth: "deep"` → `pan inspect {{ISSUE_ID}} --bead <bead-id> --deep`
     - `INSPECTION PASSED` → proceed to step 1
     - `INSPECTION BLOCKED` → fix, commit, `bd close` again, then run the same inspection command again
   - If `requiresInspection` is missing on a legacy plan item, treat it as `true` with `inspectionDepth: "fast"`.

The planning agent decides per-bead whether inspection is required and how deep it should be. Most mechanical beads carry `requiresInspection: false`; foundational beads that downstream beads build on top of carry `true`, usually with fast depth unless the plan explicitly says `inspectionDepth: "deep"`. Trust the plan — do not request inspection on beads marked `false`, do not skip inspection on beads marked `true`, and do not reuse stale metadata from before you closed the bead.

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `-l {{ISSUE_ID_LOWER}}` with `bd ready` and `bd list` to scope
to this issue's beads. The shared database contains beads from ALL issues — without the
label filter you will see irrelevant beads from other workspaces.

**NEVER use these wrong commands (agents frequently hallucinate them):**
- `bd list --issue {{ISSUE_ID}}` — the `--issue` flag does NOT exist. Use `bd list -l {{ISSUE_ID_LOWER}}` or `bd list --title-contains "{{ISSUE_ID}}"`
- `bd claim <bead-id>` — this command does NOT exist. Use `bd update <bead-id> --claim`
- `bd start <bead-id>` — this command does NOT exist. Use `bd update <bead-id> --status in_progress`

**Updating planning files does NOT close the bead.** After updating `.pan/continue.json`
and `.pan/spec.vbrief.json`, you MUST still run `bd close <bead-id> --reason="..."`.
The bead is NOT done until `bd close` succeeds.

**Do NOT implement multiple beads before committing and closing.** Each bead must be
a separate commit with a separate `bd close`. Whether inspection follows depends on
that bead's `metadata.requiresInspection` flag — see step 7 above. The inspector
specialist is NOT auto-spawned by `bd close`; when inspection is required you must
invoke `pan inspect` yourself.

**CRITICAL: Update vBRIEF AC statuses as you complete each bead.** The verification gate
checks `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` subItem statuses. If you close a bead but leave its
acceptance criteria as `pending` in the plan, verification will FAIL. After closing each
bead, update the corresponding item and subItem statuses to `completed`:
```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const p='.pan/spec.vbrief.json'; if(fs.existsSync(p)){const d=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p,'utf-8')); const items=d.plan?.items||d.items||[]; const item=items.find(i=>i.id==='ITEM_ID'); if(item){item.status='completed';(item.subItems||[]).forEach(s=>s.status='completed')}; fs.writeFileSync(p,JSON.stringify(d,null,2))}"
```
Replace `ITEM_ID` with the plan item ID that corresponds to the bead you just closed.
{{/BEADS_TASKS}}

{{#STITCH_DESIGNS}}
## UI Designs (Stitch)

The planning agent created UI designs using Google Stitch. Use these assets:

{{STITCH_DESIGNS}}

**To convert Stitch designs to React:**
- Use `/stitch-react-components` skill with the Project/Screen IDs above
- Or check if DESIGN.md already exists for styling guidelines
{{/STITCH_DESIGNS}}

{{#FEATURE_CONTEXT}}
## Feature Context (Parent Feature)

You are implementing a story that belongs to a larger Rally Feature. Reference this context to understand how your work fits into the broader initiative:

{{FEATURE_CONTEXT}}
{{/FEATURE_CONTEXT}}

{{#PENDING_FEEDBACK}}
## Specialist Feedback (ACTION REQUIRED)

Specialist agents have left feedback that you MUST address:

{{PENDING_FEEDBACK}}

**After addressing ALL feedback:** commit your fixes, then invoke the `/rebase-and-submit` skill — it will run `pan review request {{ISSUE_ID}} -m "Addressed feedback: <summary>"` for you (the correct re-review entry point; `pan done` is only for the first submission).

Do NOT `curl` any `/api/review/...` or `/api/workspaces/.../review` endpoint — those routes are for specialist/system use only, not for direct agent invocation. The `pan review request` CLI command is the only supported path. Do NOT poll specialist APIs or wait for results — the pipeline is event-driven.
{{/PENDING_FEEDBACK}}

{{#NEW_TRACKER_CONTEXT}}
{{NEW_TRACKER_CONTEXT}}
{{/NEW_TRACKER_CONTEXT}}

## CRITICAL: Check Completion Status FIRST

**Before doing ANY work, perform these checks in order:**

0. **Rebase onto latest main** (if `.pan/continue.json` or `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` already has progress — this is a restart):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
   ```
   - Clean rebase → continue. Simple conflicts (< 5 files) → resolve and `git rebase --continue`. Complex → `git rebase --abort` and note in .pan/continue.json `decisions[]`.
   - Skip this step only if no continue file exists yet (fresh start).
1. Read `.pan/continue.json` and check the `resumePoint` and `sessionHistory`
2. Check `.pan/feedback/` — if there's unaddressed feedback (review changes requested, test failures), address it FIRST
3. If `resumePoint` says "Implementation complete" or all beads are closed AND no unaddressed feedback → work is DONE
{{#LOCAL}}
3. If done, signal completion immediately:
   ```bash
   pan done {{ISSUE_ID}} -c "Work already complete from previous session"
   ```
{{/LOCAL}}
{{#REMOTE}}
3. If done, commit and push any remaining changes, then stop.
{{/REMOTE}}

**This fast-path check should take < 30 seconds. Do NOT re-analyze the entire codebase if work is done.**

## Your Task

1. Read the context files listed above
2. **FIRST:** Check `.pan/continue.json` for completion status (see above)
3. If not complete, continue implementing the planned work using the per-bead workflow below

## MANDATORY: One Bead At A Time

An automated **Inspect Specialist** runs in parallel with you. It verifies each bead's
implementation matches its specification. It needs a **scoped diff** — one bead per commit.
If you batch multiple beads into one commit, the inspector cannot verify them individually

5. **Update `.pan/continue.json`** — this is MANDATORY before closing the bead (see continue format below)
6. `bd close <bead-id> --reason="what you did"`
7. Re-read `metadata.requiresInspection` and `metadata.inspectionDepth` for this bead in `.pan/spec.vbrief.json`.
8. If inspection is required, run `pan inspect {{ISSUE_ID}} --bead <bead-id>` for fast depth or add `--deep` for deep depth; closing a bead does NOT spawn the inspector.
9. **WAIT** for the inspection result (delivered to your session via `pan tell`).
10. `INSPECTION PASSED` → proceed to step 1; `INSPECTION BLOCKED` → fix, commit, `bd close` again, then run the same inspection command again.

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `-l {{ISSUE_ID_LOWER}}` with `bd ready` and `bd list` to scope
to this issue's beads. The shared database contains beads from ALL issues — without the
label filter you will see irrelevant beads from other workspaces.

specialist is NOT auto-spawned by `bd close`; when inspection is required you must
invoke `pan inspect` yourself.

## CRITICAL: Keep `.pan/continue.json` Updated — Crash Recovery Insurance

**You may be interrupted, crash, or be stopped at any time.** If the system crashes with 50 agents
running, .pan/continue.json is the ONLY way to recover without burning expensive tokens re-discovering context.

**.pan/continue.json is updated as step 5 of every bead workflow — before `bd close`.** A hook enforces this:
if the continue file hasn't been updated since your last bead close, you'll receive a warning.

### Required .pan/continue.json Format

Your `.pan/continue.json` MUST be valid JSON with these fields:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "issueId": "{{ISSUE_ID}}",
  "created": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "updated": "<ISO timestamp — update this on every write>",
  "gitState": { "branch": "<current branch>", "sha": "<short sha>", "dirty": false },
  "decisions": [
    { "id": "D1", "summary": "<decision and why>", "recordedAt": "<ISO timestamp>" }
  ],
  "hazards": [
    { "id": "H1", "summary": "<risk/edge case>", "mitigation": "<how to handle>" }
  ],
  "resumePoint": {
    "description": "<what the next agent should do RIGHT NOW>",
    "beadId": "<current bead id>",
    "filesToRead": ["<file1>", "<file2>"]
  },
  "beadsMapping": {},
  "agentModel": "<your model>",
  "sessionHistory": [
    { "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>", "reason": "end", "note": "<what you did this session>", "agentModel": "<your model>" }
  ]
}
```

### What Makes a Good .pan/continue.json Update
- **resumePoint.description**: "Implementing bead panopticon-x8f (add retry logic to webhook handler) — need to add exponential backoff to src/lib/webhook.ts and write tests" — NOT "Working on implementation"
- **decisions**: Append new decisions as you make them. "Used Effect.retry instead of manual loop because..." — NOT "decided to write code"
- **hazards**: Add risks you discovered. "Docker network pool exhaustion if tests don't cleanup" — " mitigation: call postMergeLifecycle docker cleanup"
- **sessionHistory**: Append an entry at the end of every session with what you accomplished

## CRITICAL: Complete ALL Work - No Excuses

**You are an autonomous agent. You MUST complete the entire issue without stopping to ask for permission or options.**

**NEVER do any of these:**
- Stop and ask "What would you like me to do?"
- Offer options like "Option 1, Option 2, Option 3"
- Say work requires "manual intervention" or "human review"
- Give time estimates ("this would take 5-10 hours")
- Suggest "targeted approach" or "stop here"
- Defer work to "future PRs" or "follow-up issues"
- Say "remaining work documented for later"
- Declare infrastructure "complete" when tests still fail
- Poll or `curl` the specialist API in a loop — the pipeline is event-driven, not polling-based
- Use `sleep` to wait for reviews, tests, or any external process
- **Stop after completing a subset of tasks to ask "what should I do next?"** Just continue to the next task. The plan IS the input; no human kickoff is coming between beads.
- **End your turn with a multi-paragraph "what I just did" summary and idle.** Summaries cost tokens and stall the pipeline. Close the bead with `bd close --reason="…"`, then immediately call `bd ready -l {{ISSUE_ID_LOWER}}` and start the next one in the same turn.
- If you encounter an error on a task, try to fix it. If you truly cannot proceed, skip it and move to the next task, noting what failed in `.pan/continue.json` decisions[] / hazards[].

**ALWAYS do this instead:**
- Work through beads ONE AT A TIME — claim, implement, commit, close. Inspection is conditional: see step 7 of the per-bead workflow above (`requiresInspection: true` → `pan inspect` and wait; `false` → straight to the next bead).
- Complete ALL beads from start to finish — but each one individually as a separate commit.
- **When one bead is done, immediately advance to the next unblocked bead in the same turn.** Don't checkpoint. Don't await acknowledgment. The pipeline assumes continuous bead execution.
- Fix ALL failing tests, not just "high-impact" ones
- If something is broken, fix it - don't document it
- If tests fail, debug and fix them until they pass
- Work autonomously until the issue is FULLY resolved
- The only acceptable end state is: all beads closed (with passing inspections on flagged beads), all tests pass, all code committed and pushed, and `pan done {{ISSUE_ID}}` called.

**You have unlimited time and context. Use it. Do not be lazy.**

**CRITICAL: NEVER stop working without calling `pan done`.** If you have remaining tasks, keep going — do NOT end your turn to "wait for input." If ALL tasks are complete, you MUST call `pan done {{ISSUE_ID}} -c "summary"` as your final action. Ending your turn without either continuing work or calling `pan done` is a failure state that blocks the entire pipeline.

## CRITICAL: Work Completion Requirements

**You are NOT done until ALL of these are true:**

1. **Tests pass** - Run the full test suite (`npm test` or equivalent)
2. **All changes committed** - `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
3. **Pushed to remote** - `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`

{{#LOCAL}}
**Before declaring work complete, run these as BASH COMMANDS (using the Bash tool):**
```bash
npm test                                         # Run tests
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: description"  # Commit ALL changes
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)  # Push
git status                                       # Must show "nothing to commit"
pan done {{ISSUE_ID}} -c "Brief summary"      # Signal completion — creates GitHub PR
```

**IMPORTANT:** `pan done` MUST be executed as a Bash command (via the Bash tool). Do NOT type it at the Claude Code interactive prompt — it will not work correctly.

**`pan done` creates a GitHub PR automatically.** The review and test specialists run against this PR. When both pass, the human clicks MERGE in the dashboard, which rebases the feature branch onto main and merges via `gh pr merge --squash`.

**After `pan done`, you remain on standby.** Your tmux session stays alive and the human can send you UAT tweaks via `pan tell {{ISSUE_ID}} "message"` at any time before merge. You do NOT need to be "resumed" — `pan tell` auto-wakes you. If review fails, feedback is delivered the same way.

**If you make commits AFTER review already passed:** the review is automatically invalidated — the pipeline detects new commits and resets review to pending. Re-run `pan done` ONLY if you made NEW commits after receiving APPROVED feedback.

**If the latest feedback says "CODE APPROVED — YOUR WORK IS COMPLETE": STOP.** Do NOT make further changes. Do NOT run `pan done` again. The pipeline handles testing and merge automatically.

**If you see feedback files in `.pan/feedback/`:** read and address them before resubmitting. Ignore obsolete legacy feedback leftovers if any remain in older workspaces.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use `pan approve` — that is a supervisor-only command for humans. Agents MUST use `pan done` to signal completion.
{{/LOCAL}}
{{#REMOTE}}
When ALL tasks are complete, commit and push everything:
```bash
npm test
# Mark all vBRIEF acceptance criteria as completed (verification gate checks these)
node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const p='.pan/spec.vbrief.json'; if(fs.existsSync(p)){const d=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p,'utf-8')); const items=d.plan?.items||d.items||[]; items.forEach(i=>{i.status='completed';(i.subItems||[]).forEach(s=>s.status='completed')}); fs.writeFileSync(p,JSON.stringify(d,null,2))}"
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: description"
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
git status
```
Only stop when ALL tasks are complete or you have exhausted all possible work.
{{/REMOTE}}

**Uncommitted changes = NOT COMPLETE. Do not say you are done if `git status` shows changes.**
