/**
 * Global mutex for bd (beads) CLI commands.
 *
 * Embedded Dolt uses file-based locking — only one process can hold the
 * database lock at a time. When the dashboard spawns concurrent `bd` commands
 * (e.g. planning-state queries for every kanban card), each process blocks
 * waiting for the lock, creating a cascade of hundreds of hung processes.
 *
 * This mutex serializes all bd operations so only one runs at a time,
 * preventing lock contention and process pile-up.
