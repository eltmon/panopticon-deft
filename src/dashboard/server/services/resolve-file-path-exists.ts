/**
 * resolveFilePathExists (PAN-1457)
 *
 * Used by the dashboard's MarkdownFileLink to decide whether a path-like
 * token in chat markdown should render as a clickable file chip. The
 * regex heuristic alone produces both false positives (phantom paths
 * like `conv/2209` that look path-shaped but don't exist) and false
 * negatives (bare directory references like `src/components/Foo` that
 * are real but have no extension). This resolver is the authoritative
 * existence gate.
 *
 * Security:
 *   - Pure stat. Never reads file contents, never enumerates directories.
 *   - Treats the result as exists=false for anything that isn't a regular
 *     file or directory (sockets, FIFOs, character devices, etc.).
 *   - Symlinks: we follow them via `stat` (not `lstat`). A symlink that
 *     points to a non-existent target reports exists=false. A symlink
 *     that resolves to a real file/dir reports exists=true. We do not
 *     restrict the *target* — the caller already trusts cwd (the
 *     conversation's working directory it set itself); allowing symlinks
 *     out of cwd is no broader than what the caller could query directly
 *     with an absolute path.
