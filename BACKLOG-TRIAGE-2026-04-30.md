# Panopticon CLI Backlog Triage Report

**Date:** 2026-04-30
**Version:** 0.8.1
**Open issues at start:** 232
**Methodology:** Four parallel analysis agents audited the full backlog against the current codebase (git log, grep, file existence). Each issue was checked for: whether a fix already exists on main, whether it duplicates another issue, whether it's been superseded by architectural changes, and whether it's stale research with no traction.

---

## Part 1: Issues to Close (43 issues)

### Already Fixed / Shipped (14)

These have verified fixes on `main` — the work is done, the issue was never closed.

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|-------|----------|
| **2** | Port full /work-plan workflow to Panopticon CLI | Full planning pipeline shipped (vBRIEF, DAG, `pan plan`, planning agents) |
| **133** | Deacon idle/lazy detection false positives | Lazy detection code deleted in commit `239d2ca1b` |
| **250** | PLANNING_PROMPT.md contaminates work agent | `strip-planning-from-branch.ts` isolates planning artifacts (commit `f7f0375bf`) |
| **501** | Integrate smee.io for local GitHub webhook delivery | Integrated into `pan up`/`pan down`/`pan doctor`; `src/lib/smee.ts` exists |
| **536** | GitHub App integration for bot commit identity | `src/lib/github-app.ts` has PAN-536 header; core work done. #833 tracks remaining worktree bug |
| **650** | Deacon spams stuck agents forever | `STUCK_POKE_MAX = 3` + 15min cooldown at `deacon.ts:2862-2964` |
| **746** | Restore tests skipped for 0.7.0 release | Zero `it.skip`/`describe.skip`/`test.skip` remain in codebase |
| **808** | Merge refactor/issue-status-events | Shipped in commit `812cc2cff` |
| **846** | Reviewer and specialist tmux sessions leak | Merged via PR #851 (commit `a16dc4223`) |
| **850** | Merge flow: stuck on no-op rebase | Fixed in commit `a7e0329e1` — timeout raised, skip no-op rebase |
| **907** | Close-out doesn't live-update kanban board | Fix committed to main (commit `938392672`) |
| **909** | SyntaxError: ServiceMap export | Fixed by Effect bump to 4.0.0-beta.45 (commit `1f697f3a3`) |
| **911** | Conversations fail to attach in tmux | Fixed by stripping TMUX env (commit `16bde88b2`) |
| **922** | Dead code cleanup: DeferredTab | DeferredTab grep returns zero hits — already removed |

### Duplicates (10)

| # | Title | Duplicate of |
|---|-------|-------------|
| **365** | Light mode broken on Kanban | #146 (light mode umbrella) |
| **401** | Dashboard light mode broken | #146 |
| **553** | Plan modal: cut-off content, layout polish | #817 (planning dialog layout) |
| **579** | Ctrl+C in xterm kills Q&A prompt | #245 (Ctrl+C clipboard issue) |
| **602** | Add OpenCode as alternative runtime | #687 (same request, older) |
| **740** | Preserve new conversation draft navigating away | #548 (Command Deck state preservation) |
| **742** | Restore draft conversations on return | #548 |
| **766** | Add archived conversations view to Mission Control | #457 (archived conversations) |
| **820** | Add data-testid to interactive elements | #249 (data-testid + Playwright suite) |
| **843** | Stale reviewer tmux sessions persist | #846 (same bug, already fixed) |

### Superseded / Obsolete (10)

| # | Title | Reason |
|---|-------|--------|
| **40** | Add Models tab to dashboard | Settings page now has full model config (ProviderPanel, AgentCards, WorkTypeOverrides) |
| **103** | Progressive disclosure with resizable panels | Superseded by Command Deck layout; already tagged `wontfix` |
| **108** | Integrate Skills System + Activate Convoy | 60 skills synced; Convoy renamed to review pipeline and fully operational |
| **120** | Stitch MCP auth error | Stitch dependency has been dead since January; design work moved on |
| **121** | Redesign Settings Page with Stitch | Settings page already built; Stitch dependency dead. Tagged `wontfix` |
| **163** | PAN-TEST-1: Test regular work issue | Stale test scaffold from February; Mission Control redesigned |
| **164** | PAN-TEST-2: Test shadow/monitoring issue | Same — stale test scaffold |
| **798** | Eliminate all tmux capture-pane usage | Superseded by PAN-800 (PRD at `docs/prds/active/PAN-800`) |
| **799** | PAN-798 Research: open questions | Research companion to 798; moot after PAN-800 |
| **824** | Consolidate launcher.sh generation | Already merged (`7361131f9`); `src/lib/launcher-generator.ts` exists |

### Stale Research / No Traction (5)

| # | Title | Age | Why close |
|---|-------|-----|-----------|
| **52** | Guidance: multi-container projects with worktrees | 3 months | No traction, better as docs |
| **607** | Evaluate UBS for verification gate | 3 weeks | No references in codebase, no follow-through |
| **608** | Integrate DCG with configurable settings | 3 weeks | No references, no implementation |
| **749** | Research gstack best features | 2 weeks | No references, no action taken |
| **771** | Investigate Vercel Sandbox execution backend | 2 weeks | No references, pure research with no follow-through |

### Misplaced (2) — Move to MYN Linear

| # | Title | Reason |
|---|-------|--------|
| **268** | Create MYN project-specific Claude Code rules | MYN-specific; belongs in Linear as MIN-xxx |
| **707** | Add MCP tool to assign schedules to MYN chores | MYN product work, not Panopticon |

### Roll Into Other Issues (2)

| # | Title | Roll into |
|---|-------|----------|
| **307** | Adopt Superpowers prompt hardening | #591 (Karpathy LLM guidelines — same domain) |
| **327** | Incorporate structured verification + decision locking | #591 |

## Part 4: Thematic Summary

### What's actually working well (no action needed)
- Review pipeline (event-driven, multi-pass iterative deepening)
- Skills system (60 skills synced)
- Deacon stuck-agent handling (max pokes + cooldown implemented)
- Planning artifact isolation (strip-planning-from-branch)
- GitHub App credential support (core shipped)
- smee.io webhook delivery
- Effect.js adoption (58 files, growing)

### Biggest backlog themes
1. **1.0 readiness** — Epics B/C/D (#806, #807, #804) plus launch UX (#774) are the critical path
2. **Dashboard state & UX** — Command Deck landed but state preservation (#548), data freshness (#832), and light mode (#146) need attention
3. **Pipeline correctness** — Several confirmed bugs in feedback routing (#681), verification gates (#666, #875), and post-merge lifecycle (#304)
4. **Model/provider expansion** — Provider billing (#730 umbrella), model overrides (#532 umbrella), and router removal (#546) are the active work
5. **Operational hygiene** — 150+ branches (#863), stale stashes (#864), and legacy filesystem state need cleanup

### Key ratios
- **43 of 232 issues (19%)** can be closed right now
- **32 issues** should be consolidated into 8 parent issues
- **5 issues** are critical (1.0 blockers + active pipeline corruption)
- **~60 issues** are low-priority / post-1.0 / nice-to-have
