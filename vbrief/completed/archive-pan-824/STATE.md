# PAN-847: Command Deck polish, enrichment, motion catalog, and perf hardening

## Status: Completed

## Current Phase
All PAN-847 beads implemented. Ready for verification and merge.

## Completed Work
- [x] Planning: Created 12 beads for PAN-847 follow-up work
- [x] pan-atj7: Keyed costCache by issueId and closedIssuesCache by repo; added invariant tests (commit: ffffe192)
- [x] pan-3h57: Parallelized fetchIssueDiscussions steps 1-3 and archiveReviewerRound writes (commit: 013bcf0e)
- [x] pan-l4jb: Liveness: centralized event-to-motion catalog wiring (commit: 2dc204c1)
- [x] pan-6zyx: Zone A enrichment: activity sparkline, quality-gates, stash warning, acceptance progress (commit: 8c6cc61c)
- [x] pan-mc22: Zone B enrichment: output buffer, idle/thinking/waiting states, cost rate, summary line (commit: 71377465)
- [x] pan-0h5k: Round marker derivation from roundMetadata (commit: 0ea49ad4)
- [x] pan-35kn: Density rule: suppress default-value badges in Zone A (commit: 58c14a6b)
- [x] pan-sjj5: Overview tab: real test summary and PR summary cards (commit: 538edb8e)
- [x] pan-rtf5: Session-tab strip: Conversation/Terminal/Findings tabs (commit: 73e09b02)
- [x] pan-m1iu: Tree right-click menu: Pause, Resume, Stop, Restart, Deep Wipe, Open State Dir, View JSONL (commit: b04aeb7e)

## Remaining Work
- [x] pan-0bms: Missing Zone B overflow actions (commit: 41159ead)
- [x] pan-xvyz: PrDiffTab virtualization for large diffs (commit: adb798c9)

## Key Decisions
- Backend beads (cache keying, async fan-out) go first since they're self-contained and testable
- Frontend beads will follow in dependency order: motion catalog first (other components depend on it), then Zone A/B enrichment, then structural features (tabs, menus)
