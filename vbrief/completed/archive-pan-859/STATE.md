# PAN-859: Command Deck: clicking work-agent row in tree doesn't show terminal pane until second click

## Status: Review Follow-up Complete

## Current Phase
Resubmitting PAN-859 after fixing the review-requested specialist session regression, restoring resource discovery filtering, and restoring review coordinator observability.

## Completed Work
- [x] context-recovery: Recovered PAN-859 requirements from GitHub because `.planning/` artifacts were missing at workspace start (commit: pending)
- [x] selection-fix: Updated `src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/CommandDeck/index.tsx` so session-pane selection subscribes to `selectedSessionByIssue` directly instead of using a selector closed over `selectedFeature` (commit: pending)
- [x] regression-test: Added a regression test in `src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/CommandDeck/CommandDeck.test.tsx` covering the first session click when no feature is already selected (commit: pending)
- [x] focused-tests: Ran `npm test -- --run src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/CommandDeck/CommandDeck.test.tsx src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/CommandDeck/__tests__/IssueWorkbench.test.tsx src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/CommandDeck/ProjectTree/FeatureItem.test.tsx` and got 31 passing tests across 3 files (commit: pending)
- [x] playwright-pan-859: Verified in Playwright that clicking the PAN-859 work-agent row opens the agent pane on the first click and that a second click is idempotent; screenshot saved as `pan-859-first-click.png` (commit: pending)
- [x] review-nit: Removed the duplicate Google Fonts Material Symbols stylesheet include from `docs/design/mockups/command-deck-terminology-map.html` per approved review feedback (commit: pending)
- [x] test-hardening: Reset the CommandDeck selection store in `beforeEach` and added an explicit second-click idempotency regression test in `CommandDeck.test.tsx` (commit: pending)
- [x] review-followup: Removed unreachable origin-validation fallback code in `conversations.ts` and its mirrored test helper, and tightened the CommandDeck conversation-switch test to assert `conversation-panel` renders with real mocked conversation data (commit: pending)
- [x] review-blocker-fix: Restored per-issue specialist tmux session resolution and tmux-liveness-derived status in `src/dashboard/server/routes/command-deck.ts` so running specialists resolve to the correct session and no longer show stale ended/running state (commit: pending)
- [x] resource-filter-fix: Restored active/live resource discovery filtering in `src/dashboard/server/services/resource-discovery.ts` so stale merged issues with leftover branches/workspaces do not pollute the Command Deck tree (commit: pending)
- [x] coordinator-observability-fix: Restored review coordinator exit visibility in `src/lib/cloister/review-agent.ts` by removing error swallowing, enabling `remain-on-exit`, and logging output plus exit status under `.pan/review/coordinator/` (commit: pending)
- [x] review-followup-verification: Passed `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and targeted Vitest regressions after the latest review-requested fixes (commit: pending)

## Remaining Work
- [x] cross-session-verification: Verified the same first-click session-row behavior on PAN-855's work session in the live tree; screenshot saved as `pan-859-cross-session-verification.png` (commit: pending)
- [x] final-quality-gates: Passed `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` (327 files / 3983 tests passed, 4 files / 48 tests skipped) (commit: pending)
- [x] commit-and-finish: Committed the PAN-859 changes, pushed `feature/pan-859`, and ran the issue completion flow with `pan done PAN-859` (commit: 0db98231)

## Key Decisions
- Subscribe to the full `selectedSessionByIssue` map in `CommandDeck/index.tsx` instead of selecting through a closure over `selectedFeature`; this addresses the root cause where feature selection and session selection changed in the same click but the component did not reliably observe the session-slice update.
- Added the regression at the CommandDeck integration level rather than only in store tests because the bug was in the React subscription/render path, not the pure selection helper.
