# Panopticon Planning Lifecycle

`pan plan <id>` starts a planning session for an issue. Use `--auto` when the user wants the planning agent to run non-interactively and infer defensible defaults.

## Available commands

```bash
pan plan <id> [--auto] [--model <model>] [--harness claude-code|pi] [--effort low|medium|high] [--local|--remote]
pan plan finalize [-w <path>] [--json] [--no-promote]
pan plan done <id>
```

## Starting planning

```bash
pan plan PAN-1071
```

This calls the dashboard planning endpoint, creates the planning workspace, and starts the planning agent. The dashboard can also start the same flow from the issue card's **Plan…** action.

## Auto-planning

```bash
pan plan PAN-1071 --auto
```

Auto-planning runs the same planning agent without interactive questions:

- The agent must not ask the user questions.
- Ambiguous but non-contradictory choices are resolved with defensible defaults.
- Inferred choices are recorded in `plan.autoDecisions[]` with a summary and rationale.
- The agent escalates only when authoritative inputs genuinely contradict each other.

The dashboard issue card's **Auto-plan** action sends the same `auto: true` request.

## Finalizing (`pan plan finalize`)

Run this from inside the planning workspace after the planning agent has produced a complete `.pan/spec.vbrief.json`.

```bash
pan plan finalize
```

What it does:

1. Reads `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` from the current workspace (walks up if needed).
2. Materializes each `plan.items[]` entry into a corresponding bead, respecting declared dependencies.
3. Flips the spec's `plan.status` from `draft` to `proposed`.
4. Calls the dashboard's complete-planning endpoint to promote the canonical spec into `<projectRoot>/.pan/specs/`, commit it on main, push, transition the tracker state to Planned, and terminate the planning session — same flow as `pan plan done` and the dashboard Done button.
5. Returns a summary of beads created and promotion status, or JSON with `--json`.

Use `-w <path>` to point at another workspace. Use `--no-promote` to leave the spec at `status=proposed` without promoting (rare; for humans who want to review the plan in the dashboard before clicking Done).

## Completing planning (`pan plan done`)

`pan plan done <id>` exists for cases where finalize was run with `--no-promote`, or where a planning agent crashed between writing the spec and promoting. It calls the same complete-planning endpoint that `finalize` chains to.

```bash
pan plan done PAN-1071
```

This promotes the workspace vBRIEF to `<projectRoot>/.pan/specs/`, syncs beads, and transitions the tracker state to Planned.

## Related commands

- `pan start <id>` — start implementation from an existing vBRIEF and beads.
- `pan start <id> --auto` — skip planning and synthesize a minimal vBRIEF/beads from the issue title/body before starting work.
- `pan tell <id> <message>` — send feedback to a running planning or work agent.
- `pan kill <id>` — stop a planning or work agent without deleting the workspace.
