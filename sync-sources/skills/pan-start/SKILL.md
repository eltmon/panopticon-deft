# pan start

Run the command now:

```bash
pan start <issue-id>
```

## Usage

```
pan start PAN-123          # Spawn agent for issue PAN-123
pan start MIN-456          # Works with any tracker prefix
pan start PAN-123 --force  # Clear a paused agent gate and start anyway
pan start PAN-123 --host   # Break-glass: bypass workspace Docker stack-health gate
```

## What It Does

Creates a git worktree at `workspaces/feature-<id>/`, installs dependencies, then spawns
an autonomous Claude Code agent in a tmux session (`agent-<id>`). The agent loads the
issue spec, creates a plan, and begins implementation.

If an agent is paused, `pan start <id>` refuses to spawn until you run `pan unpause <id>`.
Use `--force` only when you intentionally want to clear that pause gate and start anyway.

For projects with workspace Docker configured, `pan start` checks stack health before
spawning. Use `--host` only as an explicit break-glass override; interactive shells always
prompt, while non-interactive callers must pass `--yes` to confirm.

## When to Use

- Starting work on a new issue
- Launching an agent after planning is complete

## See Also

- `pan plan <id>` — create an execution plan before starting
- `pan show <id>` — inspect agent state while it works
- `pan tell <id>` — send a message to the running agent
- `pan done <id>` — signal the agent has completed its work
