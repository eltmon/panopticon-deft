description: Find, review, read, inspect, summarize, or compare Panopticon conversations. Use when the user references a pan.localhost/conv/<id> URL, a conversation ID (e.g. "conv 371", "conversation 108"), a fuzzy reference ("that GPT conversation", "the last Sonnet session"), or asks to review/read/look at/check/summarize/compare conversations. Maps conversation IDs to Claude Code JSONL session files and parses session content. Read-only.

# Conversation Lookup

Use this skill whenever the user references a Panopticon conversation — by `pan.localhost/conv/<id>` URL, numeric id, conversation name, or a fuzzy reference like "that GPT conversation". Handles single-conversation review, recent-conversation listing, search, and side-by-side comparison.

## When to use

- User asks about a specific conversation ID (e.g., "check conv/108", "what was happening in conversation 42?")
- User pastes a `https://pan.localhost/conv/<id>` URL and asks you to review, read, or look at it
- User wants to compare two conversations (e.g., voice/style diff across models)
- User wants to resume or summarize a past conversation
- User asks for recent conversation history
- Need to find the JSONL session file for a conversation to analyze its content

> **Do not** try `WebFetch` on `pan.localhost/conv/<id>` — the dashboard is an SPA and WebFetch will return empty page chrome. Always go through the script / DB.

## How it works

Every Panopticon conversation is tracked in the SQLite database at `~/.panopticon/panopticon.db` in the `conversations` table. Each row maps to a Claude Code JSONL session file in `~/.claude/projects/-home-eltmon-Projects/`.

## Running commands

The script is at the root of this skill directory. Always run it from any working directory.

### Find a specific conversation

```bash
python3 scripts/conv-find.py <id>
```

Example output:
```text
Conversation #108
  Name:          20260412-4175
  Status:        ended
  Model:         claude-opus-4-6
  Effort:        medium
  CWD:           ~/Projects
  Issue:         N/A
  Title:         Lexerra game rules query out of scope
  Cost:          $22.90
  Created:       2026-04-12T01:44:30.908Z
  Ended:         2026-04-12T17:00:06.619Z
  Session file:  ~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/<session-id>.jsonl

  Session messages: 130
  By role:        assistant=62, user=68
  Tool uses:      41
  First prompt:   I don't have any information about a game called "Lexerra"...
  Last prompt:    That means the new code is running but still producing nonsense words...
  Last assistant: I traced the remaining nonsense generation to...
```

### Get only the JSONL path

```bash
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --jsonl 108
```

### Print a normalized summary of recent notable messages

```bash
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --summary 108
```

This includes recent messages with:
- line number in the JSONL
- role
- tool names used in that message
- normalized text snippet

### Output machine-readable JSON

```bash
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --json 108
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --recent 20 --json
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --search gpt-5.4 --json
```

For a single conversation, `--json` includes:
- database metadata
- a `session_summary` object with normalized session info

### List recent conversations

```bash
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --recent 20   # default 20
```

### Search by title/cwd/model

```bash
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --search lexerra
python3 scripts/conv-find.py --search gpt-5.4
```

## Session parsing behavior

The script now tolerates the JSONL message shape variations seen in real Claude Code sessions.

### Supported shapes

`message.content` may be:
- a plain string
- a list of strings
- a list of typed blocks

Typed blocks may include:
- `text`
- `thinking`
- `tool_use`
- `tool_result`

The parser normalizes these into:
- text fragments
- tool names
- role/timestamp/line metadata

## Parsing session content manually

If you still need custom parsing, do not assume `message.content` is always a list of dict blocks.

```python
import json, pathlib

path = pathlib.Path(session_file)
for line in path.read_text().splitlines():
    if not line.strip():
        continue
    try:
        obj = json.loads(line)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        continue
    msg = obj.get("message")
    if not isinstance(msg, dict):
        continue
    content = msg.get("content")
    # content may be a string, list[str], or list[dict]
```

## Key database columns

The `conversations` table has these useful columns:
- `id` — numeric conversation ID (the number in `/conv/<id>`)
- `name` — Panopticon-generated name (e.g., `20260412-4175`)
- `status` — `active` or `ended`
- `cwd` — working directory when spawned
- `issue_id` — associated issue (null for manual convs)
- `session_file` — full path to the JSONL session file
- `title` — auto/AI-set title from first message
- `title_seed` — original user message that started the conversation
- `total_cost` — cached total cost in USD
- `model` — model used (e.g., `claude-opus-4-6`, `gpt-5.4`)
- `effort` — effort level (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- `created_at`, `ended_at` — timestamps

## Quick SQL queries

For direct database queries:
```bash
# Find conversation by ID
sqlite3 ~/.panopticon/panopticon.db "SELECT id, name, status, session_file, title, model, created_at FROM conversations WHERE id = 108;"

# Search by keyword in title
sqlite3 ~/.panopticon/panopticon.db "SELECT id, session_file, title FROM conversations WHERE title LIKE '%lexerra%';"
```

## Comparing two conversations

When the user wants a voice/approach/regression diff between two conversations:

1. Resolve both via `python3 scripts/conv-find.py --json <id>` to get `session_file` and `model`.
2. Extract readable text from each session file (use `--summary`, or jq for full text).
3. Present side-by-side labelled by model, so style differences are obvious.

Typical use cases: "how did GPT-5.4 handle this vs Sonnet?", "compare conv 365 and 366", "why does the GPT version feel clunkier?".

## See Also

- `unarchive-conversation` — restore an archived Panopticon conversation to active state (write operation; use this if the conversation you're reviewing is archived and you want it live in Mission Control)
- `pan show <id>` — inspect agent state for *issue* work (different scope — agents working on issues, not user conversations)
