Any test that exercises retry logic, Retry-After headers, exponential backoff, or delay-based code MUST use `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` / `vi.runAllTimersAsync()`. Never rely on real `setTimeout` for delays in tests.

Why:
- Real 2-second retry delays × multiple attempts × many tests in the same file keep test contexts (and their fetch mocks, abort controllers, intervals) alive in memory long enough to cause OOM when parallelized across workers.
- The symptom is a suite that "needs" `maxForks: 1` to pass — that is hiding the real bug, not fixing it.

The correct pattern for a retry-after test:

```ts
import { vi, describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'vitest';

beforeEach(() => { vi.useFakeTimers(); });
afterEach(() => { vi.useRealTimers(); });

it('retries after Retry-After delay', async () => {
  const resultPromise = callTheThing();
  // Drain the fetch mock's first response, then advance past retry-after
  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(2000);
  // ... repeat for each retry ...
  const result = await resultPromise;
  expect(result).toEqual(...);
});
```

NEVER:
- Use real setTimeouts with `retry-after: '2'` or similar — each attempt burns 2s of wall-clock.
- Drop `maxForks` to 1 to mask an OOM caused by slow tests — that serializes the whole suite.
- Raise `--max-old-space-size` to paper over a leak in test scaffolding.

If a test must wait for real-wall-clock delay (genuine I/O timing, flake-hunt reproducers), put it in a separate file tagged `@slow` and excluded from the default run.
