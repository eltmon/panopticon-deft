# Panopticon CLI - Development Guidelines

> **Note:** Universal and dev-scope engineering rules — async tmux, no execSync in server, fake timers for retry tests, worktree discipline, work-agents-via-pan, stash discipline, dashboard-Node22-only, single-deacon invariant, no-destructive-requests, file-path references, Karpathy rules — live in [`sync-sources/rules/`](sync-sources/rules/) and are folded into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` automatically via `pan sync`. This file holds **project-specific** guidance that doesn't apply outside this repo.

## Engineering Philosophy: No Bandaids

**NEVER apply workarounds, hacks, or "just get it working" fixes.** Every issue, no matter how minor, must be addressed at its root cause as soon as it arises. If something is broken, find out WHY it's broken and fix the underlying problem — don't paper over symptoms with fallback chains or special-case handling.

This means:
- Investigate before fixing. Understand the full causal chain.
- If a fix requires understanding code you haven't read, read it first.
- If a component is generating bad data, fix the component — don't add defensive code downstream to tolerate bad data.
- If an agent is misbehaving, fix the agent's constraints — don't add monitoring to catch the misbehavior after the fact.

## CRITICAL: Never Work Around Broken Things — Fix Them

**When something is broken, FIX IT. Never manually do what the code should do, never dismiss errors as "transient", never bypass a broken tool by using an alternative.**

This means:
- If a test should verify behavior, don't manually verify it — fix the test and run it.
- If an API endpoint should create beads, don't run `bd init` manually — fix the endpoint.
- If Playwright MCP crashes, don't fall back to `curl` — investigate why it crashed and fix it.
- If a label should be removed by the merge flow, don't run `gh issue edit` — fix the merge flow.
- If the dashboard should show the right status, don't tell the user to refresh — fix the data pipeline.

**Every workaround is a bug you chose not to fix.** The user has stated this hundreds of times: always pick up the trash, never walk over it, zero intentional technical debt. This applies to EVERYTHING — tools, tests, data, UI, infrastructure. No exceptions.

## CRITICAL: Never Do Agent Work — Fix the System

**When an agent produces bad results (incomplete work, wrong output, passing with known issues), NEVER fix the output yourself. Fix the Panopticon system that allowed the bad result.**

This means:
- Review agent passes with known issues → Fix the review agent prompt or acceptance criteria so it BLOCKS instead of passing
- Work agent leaves dead code or uncommitted changes → Fix the verification gate or done flow to catch it
- Merge agent fails silently → Fix the failure reporting in the pipeline
- NEVER edit workspace files to fix what an agent should have done
- NEVER manually run commands that a pipeline flow should handle
- ALWAYS ask "why did the system allow this?" before touching any code

The goal is autonomous correctness. Every manual intervention is a system bug.

## CRITICAL: Deliver Complete Features — No Partial Implementations

**Unless explicitly asked to break work into phases, deliver the entire feature in a single issue.** A feature is idempotent — partial delivery provides zero value to the end user.

- A PRD may describe phases for organizational clarity, but the agent MUST implement ALL phases before calling `pan done`.
- Do not merge a subset of a feature and call it done. If the issue says "redesign the kanban board", that means ALL aspects of the redesign — not just the easy parts.
- "Large refactor" is not an excuse to ship incomplete work. The size of the change is the size of the change.
- If a feature genuinely cannot be completed in one session (e.g., token limits), the agent should document exactly what remains and NOT signal completion. The issue stays open until ALL work is done.
- PRD phases are implementation guidance, not separate deliverables.

## CRITICAL: JSONL Session Files Are Sacred — NEVER Delete

**NEVER delete, overwrite, or truncate Claude Code JSONL session files** (`~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`). These files are the only record of conversation history — they contain the user's work, context, and decisions. Losing them is irreversible data loss.

**Rules:**
- **NEVER delete a JSONL file** unless the user explicitly asks AND you have confirmed with them a second time ("Are you sure? This cannot be undone.")
- **NEVER delete JSONL files as part of cleanup operations** — cleaning up orphaned conversations means removing DB records and killing tmux sessions, NOT touching JSONL files
- **NEVER assume a JSONL file is "garbage"** based on size — even small files may represent conversations the user is actively working with
- Code that programmatically deletes JSONL files (e.g., `fs.unlinkSync` on a session path) must NEVER be written without explicit user instruction
- When cleaning up failed forks or orphaned conversations, leave the JSONL files intact

## Commit and Push When Working on Main

When working directly on `main` (not in a Panopticon workspace), commit completed changes and push to `origin` before ending the session. Agent PRs merge to `origin/main` through the pipeline — unpushed local commits cause divergence that requires manual merge resolution. Don't commit half-done work; finish the change, verify it builds, then commit and push.

## CRITICAL: Releases Go Through `pan release stable` — Never Manual

**To cut a new release of `@panctl/*`, ALWAYS use `pan release stable --version X.Y.Z`. NEVER run `git tag v...` manually, never edit `"version"` in any `package.json` directly, never `npm version` or `npm publish`.**

The release tooling does five things atomically that humans (and agents) get wrong piecemeal:

1. Bumps `package.json`, `apps/desktop/package.json`, `packages/contracts/package.json` together (mismatches silently break the npm publish).
2. Generates rich release notes from `git log <prev-tag>..HEAD` into `.release/<tag>.md`.
3. Commits everything with the canonical subject `chore: release X.Y.Z`.
4. Creates an annotated tag.
5. Lets the CI release pipeline publish to npm via OIDC and create the GitHub Release with attached desktop binaries.

**How to release:**

```bash
# From a clean main, after the change you want to ship is committed
pan release stable --version 0.9.4
git push origin main
git push origin v0.9.4
```

**Guards already in place** (if you bypass them, you're working against the system):

- `.husky/pre-push` rejects any `v*` tag whose commit doesn't have matching `package.json` versions and a committed `.release/<tag>.md`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` re-runs the same check on the runner side; tags missing the artifacts cause the release pipeline to fail loudly before any publish.
- `.husky/commit-msg` rejects commits that change a `package.json` version field unless the subject is `chore: release X.Y.Z`. This catches the failure one step earlier than the push hook.

**If asked to "release", "tag", "bump version", "publish", or anything similar:** the answer is `pan release stable --version X.Y.Z`. Never a workaround, never a manual tag, never `--no-verify`.

## Harnesses

Panopticon supports two coding-agent harnesses: `claude-code` (default) and `pi` (alternative, multi-provider). The harness is picked per spawn at plan kickoff, role runs, work agent start, and the conversation panel; roles read harness/model defaults from Settings. Pi + Anthropic + subscription auth is the only blocked combination (ToS gate in `src/lib/harness-policy.ts`).

See [configuration/harnesses.mdx](configuration/harnesses.mdx) for installation, picker locations, ToS rules, and troubleshooting. The wider field of coding-agent harnesses Panopticon could adopt is surveyed in [reference/harness-landscape.mdx](reference/harness-landscape.mdx). (`docs/HARNESSES.md` is now a redirect stub — the harness docs are published in the Mintlify site.)

## Panopticon Agent Taxonomy

Panopticon's issue pipeline is expressed as four spawned **roles** plus a server-side merge handoff:

| Role | Purpose | Instruction source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan` | Discover requirements and produce vBRIEF/beads artifacts | `roles/plan.md` |
| `work` | Implement one bead at a time in the workspace | `roles/work.md` |
| `review` | Synthesize code review and transition approved/blocked work | `roles/review.md` |
| `test` | Run automated verification and required browser UAT | `roles/test.md` |

Shipping is server-side: `rebaseFeatureBranch()` prepares branches and PAN-1650's review-status gate derives `readyForMerge`; no `roles/ship.md` file exists and no ship agent is spawned. The `ship` token survives only as the merge-specialist identity for model routing, historical activity attribution, and old session records.

Sub-roles are configuration slots under a role, not standalone pipeline stages. All sub-roles today are delivered as **harness-agnostic prompt templates** that the orchestrator inlines into spawn messages:

- **`review.security` / `review.correctness` / `review.performance` / `review.requirements`** — Panopticon reads `roles/review-<subRole>.md` and inlines the body into each convoy spawn message. Never loaded via Claude's `--agent` flag, never synced into project workspaces.
- **`work.inspect` / `work.inspect-deep`** — same shape: the inspection prompt is workflow-injected, not auto-discovered.

`.claude/agents/` is **deliberately empty** in this repo. The directory exists in worktrees only as a sync target for the Claude Code harness, but Panopticon ships no ambient subagents there. Two reasons: (1) ambient subagents leak into every Claude Code session and can fire at moments the workflow doesn't intend; (2) ambient subagent definitions can hardcode model assumptions (e.g. `model: haiku`) that break on non-Anthropic-routed agents (CLIProxy → gpt-5.5), since the harness doesn't always thread provider routing through to the subagent call. When a role needs codebase exploration or general-purpose subagent work, it uses Claude Code's built-in subagent types (`Explore`, `general-purpose`), which inherit the parent's model and routing context properly.

`.claude/skills/` is also a workspace sync target, not a source of truth — same gitignore policy (PAN-1090).

The full mental model — Role vs Claude subagent vs Panopticon pipeline agent — lives in [docs/ROLES.md](docs/ROLES.md). For review specifically, see [docs/REVIEW-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/REVIEW-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md).

Legacy specialist wake/session/queue machinery has been removed. Use `spawnRun(issueId, role, opts)` and lifecycle state transitions instead of waking named specialists.

## Skills ↔ CLI Convention

The `pan` binary's subcommands and Claude Code's `pan-*` skills follow a strict convention:

- **`pan <verb>`** (CLI subcommand) is wrapped by **`/pan-<verb>`** (a skill at `skills/pan-<verb>/SKILL.md`).
- The `pan-` prefix is also a namespace for workflow / reference / topical skills (`/pan-workflow`, `/pan-code-review`, `/pan-network`) that don't map 1:1 to a single verb.
- Not every CLI verb gets a wrapper skill — only verbs where the skill adds non-trivial guidance beyond `--help`. The current exclusion list and the criteria are documented in [docs/SKILLS-CONVENTION.md](docs/SKILLS-CONVENTION.md).
- **When the CLI changes, the wrapper skill changes in the same commit.** `scripts/lint-skills.sh` (wired into `npm run lint`) enforces this by cross-checking every flag and subcommand a wrapper SKILL.md mentions against the actual `pan <verb> --help` output. Drift fails CI.

See [docs/SKILLS-CONVENTION.md](docs/SKILLS-CONVENTION.md) for the full rules, shapes (CLI-wrapper / CLI-sub-wrapper / Workflow / Reference / Topical), and creating-a-new-skill checklist.

## Planning Modes

Panopticon supports two planning modes:

### Interactive (default)
```bash
pan plan <id>
```
Launches an interactive planning session where the agent asks Q&A questions before producing a vBRIEF.

### Auto (non-interactive)
```bash
pan plan <id> --auto
```
Runs the planning agent end-to-end without prompting. If it encounters a contradiction it can't resolve, it escalates to interactive mode. All inferred choices are recorded in `plan.autoDecisions[]` for audit.

### Auto-Start (skip planning)
```bash
pan start <id> --auto
```
Skips the planning agent entirely. Synthesizes a minimal vBRIEF from the issue title/body, creates beads, and spawns the work agent directly. For trivial issues (typos, version bumps) where full planning is overkill.

**Always verify available flags with `pan <verb> --help`** — the CLI is self-documenting and flags may change between versions.

## Project Structure

- **Stack**: TypeScript, Node.js 22+, React dashboard, SQLite, Effect.js
- **Build**: `npm run build` (tsdown for CLI/server/contracts, Vite for frontend)
- **Dev**: `npm run dev` (tsx watch)
- **Dashboard**: Must use Node 22 (built dist) — `nohup /home/eltmon/.config/nvm/versions/node/v22.22.0/bin/node dist/dashboard/server.js`
  - **NEVER use `bun run src/dashboard/server/main.ts`** — two reasons:
    1. **node-pty** (`@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch`) is a native Node addon. Under Bun's addon compat layer the PTY spawns but exits with code 0 immediately, breaking `/ws/terminal` for all workspaces.
    2. **Circular ESM deps** — the dashboard source has circular imports that Bun tolerates but Node.js strict ESM rejects, so tsx/source-mode also fails under Node.
  - `pan up` handles this automatically — it runs `dist/dashboard/server.js` under Node 22. Run `npm run build` first if the dist is stale.
  - See [docs/PANOPTICON_DEV_SOP.md](docs/PANOPTICON_DEV_SOP.md) for startup, mode switching, restart guarantees, and failure triage.
- **Issue tracking**: GitHub Issues (PAN-XXX prefix), NOT Linear
- **Package manager**: Bun (bun.lock, `bun install`, `bun add`)
- **Workspaces**: Bun workspaces — `packages/contracts`, `src/dashboard/server`, `src/dashboard/frontend`
- **Build configs**: tsdown.config.ts (root for CLI, src/dashboard/server/ for server, packages/contracts/ for contracts, scripts/ for cost script)

## Workspace Setup for Agents

Workspaces are git worktrees at `workspaces/feature-<issue-id>/`. Each worktree has its
own `node_modules` created by `bun install` — **never symlink node_modules from the main repo**.
Symlinks break local workspace package resolution (e.g., `@panctl/contracts` would
resolve to the main repo's stale build instead of the worktree's version).

See [docs/WORKSPACE-CONTAINERS.md](docs/WORKSPACE-CONTAINERS.md) for the workspace
container contract, stack-health surfaces, spawn gate, and recovery commands.

**Before running builds or tests in a workspace:**
1. Run `bun install` from the workspace root (creates correct workspace-aware node_modules)
2. If you modified `packages/contracts/`, rebuild: `cd packages/contracts && npm run build`
3. Build commands use the root `node_modules/.bin/` — run from workspace root, not subdirectories

**NEVER symlink node_modules** — `bun install` uses hardlinks from the global cache and is
nearly instant (~2s). It correctly resolves `@panctl/contracts` to the worktree's local
`packages/contracts/` via Bun workspace resolution.

**Quality gates** (must pass before `pan done`):
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript strict mode
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm test` — Vitest (root + frontend)

## tmux Socket — CRITICAL

**Panopticon agents run under a separate tmux socket named `panopticon`.** Always use `-L panopticon` when inspecting agent sessions:

```bash
# List all agent sessions
tmux -L panopticon list-sessions

# Attach or capture a specific agent
tmux -L panopticon capture-pane -t agent-min-846 -p -S -50
tmux -L panopticon attach -t agent-min-846
```

The default tmux socket (`/tmp/tmux-1000/default`) is NOT used by agents. Plain `tmux list-sessions` will show "no server running" or list unrelated sessions. This is a common source of false "agent not found" errors.

## PTY supervisor for orchestrator delivery

Claude Code work agents and Claude Code conversation sessions use the PTY
supervisor as the preferred orchestrator-to-agent delivery path. The launcher
wraps Claude as `node <projectRoot>/dist/pty-supervisor.js claude ...`, exports
`PANOPTICON_AGENT_ID`, and writes a per-agent `pty-token` under
`${PANOPTICON_HOME}/agents/<id>/pty-token` before the tmux session starts.

The supervisor is Node 22-only because it owns a real PTY through
`@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch`; do not run it under Bun. It binds
`${PANOPTICON_HOME}/sockets/pty-<id>.sock` at mode `0600`, accepts authenticated
HTTP-on-unix POSTs, writes each delivered message into Claude's PTY input, and
echoes the message into the tmux transcript so operators can see what was sent.

`deliverAgentMessage(agentId, message, caller?)` is the single delivery
primitive. In automatic mode it tries, in order:

1. PTY supervisor socket (`path: "supervisor"`)
2. legacy Claude Code Channels MCP socket for already-wired sessions
3. tmux paste-buffer fallback

Docker workspaces remain excluded from supervisor wiring until host/container
socket sharing is designed; Pi keeps using its `rpc.in` FIFO. H1 lifecycle
semantics apply: the supervisor owns Claude's PTY master fd, so if the
supervisor process exits, Claude exits with it and the session must be resumed
through the normal dashboard/Deacon flow.

## Claude Code Channels (experimental legacy fallback)

Reference: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels

Claude Code Channels is now a legacy fallback — see the PTY supervisor section
above for the recommended transport. Channels remains only for already-running
agents with `state.channelsEnabled = true` and for explicit diagnostic opt-in
via `experimental.claudeCodeChannelsMcp: true`.

`src/lib/channels/panopticon-bridge.ts` is a per-agent Bun stdio MCP server.
When the diagnostic override is enabled, Claude is spawned with
`--mcp-config <workspace>/.pan/agent-mcp.json --dangerously-load-development-channels server:panopticon-bridge`,
the bridge listens on `${PANOPTICON_HOME}/sockets/agent-<id>.sock`, and
`deliverAgentMessage` uses it only after the supervisor tier fails. The
`WARNING: Loading development channels` dialog is dismissed only when that MCP
config is actually wired; supervisor-only sessions must not receive this Enter
keystroke.

## Dashboard Server Architecture (Effect + Raw WebSocket)

The dashboard server uses **Effect.js** for HTTP routes and structured RPC, plus a
**raw WebSocket** endpoint for terminal streaming.

**Server structure** (split from old 15K-line monolith in PAN-428):
- `src/dashboard/server/main.ts` — entry point, dual-runtime (Bun dev, Node prod)
- `src/dashboard/server/server.ts` — Effect HTTP server, route composition, layers
- `src/dashboard/server/ws-rpc.ts` — Effect RPC over WebSocket at `/ws/rpc`
- `src/dashboard/server/ws-terminal.ts` — raw WebSocket terminal at `/ws/terminal`
- `src/dashboard/server/routes/*.ts` — 12 route modules (issues, agents, workspaces, etc.)
- `src/dashboard/server/services/*.ts` — domain services (event store, read model, cache, enrichment, etc.)
- `src/dashboard/server/read-model.ts` — in-memory read model, bootstrapped from lib modules

**Two WebSocket endpoints:**
- `/ws/rpc` — Effect RPC (PanRpcGroup): domain events, snapshots, replay. Uses typed Schema.
- `/ws/terminal?session=<name>` — Raw WebSocket: live PTY terminal streaming via `ws` library.
  Terminal data bypasses Effect RPC because the RPC serialization layer can't handle
  high-throughput binary-like terminal data reliably.

**Terminal architecture** (`ws-terminal.ts` + `XTerminal.tsx`):
- Server: raw `WebSocketServer` with `noServer: true`, deferred PTY spawn (waits for
  client resize dimensions), `node-pty` spawns `tmux attach-session`
- Client: raw `WebSocket` API with exponential backoff reconnection
- PTY waits for tmux session to exist (`waitForTmuxSession`) before spawning
- Data flows immediately on attach — no stale data suppression
- Dimension toggle at 200ms forces correct-size repaint

**Frontend data flow:**
- `EventRouter.tsx` → connects to `/ws/rpc`, fetches snapshot via `getSnapshot` RPC,
  subscribes to `subscribeDomainEvents` stream, applies events to Zustand store
- `WsTransport.ts` — Effect-based RPC client with auto-reconnection
- Store: Zustand with shared reducers from `@panctl/contracts`

**Session lifecycle rules:**
- On WebSocket close, do NOT kill the PTY — the tmux session survives independently.
- Do NOT pre-resize tmux windows. Let the PTY spawn handle sizing via client dimensions.
- The planning launcher script MUST export TERM/COLORTERM/LANG for Claude Code rendering.
- Planning sessions use `remain-on-exit on` + `destroy-unattached off` so the session
  survives after the agent exits, until the user clicks Done.

## Verification Gate (PAN-174)

After a work agent signals completion, Cloister runs quality gates from `projects.yaml`
before advancing to the review role. If typecheck/lint/test fail, feedback is sent to the
agent's tmux session and the completion marker is NOT processed (allowing retry).
After 3 consecutive failures, verification is bypassed to prevent permanent blocking.

## Agent Auto-Resume Gates

Deacon auto-resume is intentionally suppressible through three gates:

- **Boot no-resume:** `PANOPTICON_NO_RESUME=1`, `pan dev --no-resume`, or
  `pan up --no-resume` disables orphan recovery and stopped-agent auto-resume for
  that dashboard boot only. Restart without `--no-resume` to restore patrols.
- **Manual pause:** `pan pause <id> [--reason <text>]` persists `paused` fields in
  `~/.panopticon/agents/<agent-id>/state.json` and stops the agent if it is running.
  `pan unpause <id>` clears the gate without spawning. `pan start <id>` refuses
  paused agents unless `--force` is passed; `--force` clears the pause gate first.
- **Troubled gate:** repeated resume/crash failures mark an agent `troubled` and
  preserve failure counters/backoff state in `state.json`. `pan untroubled <id>`
  clears the troubled gate and failure fields after the underlying crash cause has
  been investigated. It does not spawn the agent.

These gates are orthogonal to the global Deacon freeze in SQLite
(`deacon.globally_paused`) and the per-issue Deacon ignore flag in review status.

## Project Resolution from Issue IDs

Issue IDs are resolved to projects via `resolveProjectFromIssue()` in `src/lib/projects.ts`
and `parseGitHubRepos()` in `src/lib/tracker-utils.ts`. Resolution order:

1. Match `linear_team` field in `projects.yaml` (e.g., `linear_team: MIN` matches `MIN-123`)
2. For GitHub-only projects without `linear_team`, derive prefix from the project key
   (e.g., project key `krux` → prefix `KRUX` matches `KRUX-3`)

When adding a new project to `projects.yaml`, either set `linear_team` explicitly or
ensure the project key (uppercased, hyphens removed) matches the issue prefix you want.

## Beads Enforcement

Work agents cannot start without beads tasks in the workspace. The start-agent endpoint
returns 422 if `.beads/issues.jsonl` does not exist. Planning must create beads via
`bd create` before handing off to implementation.

## postMergeLifecycle Idempotency (enforced by a test, not by this note)

`postMergeLifecycle` must run **at most once per merge**. If it can re-trigger
itself, you get an infinite loop — that once burned 24,626 tracker API calls
(PAN-328). The original loop was:
specialists/done → onMergeComplete → postMergeLifecycle → (re-trigger) → specialists/done.

This protection is now **structural, not advisory** — you don't have to remember
a rule:

- The concurrency guard is `createInFlightGuard()` in
  `src/lib/cloister/in-flight-guard.ts`, used by `firePostMergeLifecycle` in
  `src/dashboard/server/routes/specialists.ts`. A second *concurrent* call for
  the same issue is a no-op.
- It is locked by `tests/unit/lib/cloister/in-flight-guard.test.ts`. **Weaken or
  delete the guard and that suite goes red** — that is the real protection.
- `postMergeLifecycle` also checks `mergeStatus` / `_completedPostMerge`
  (defense-in-depth).

So the rule is just: if you touch the merge-completion path, keep that test
green. A red guard test means you've reopened the loop. Adding new work to the
post-merge path (e.g. a rolling re-rebase fan-out) is fine as long as it stays
idempotent and the test stays green.

## postMergeLifecycle Verify Handoff and Docker Cleanup

`postMergeLifecycle()` in `merge-agent.ts` is a non-destructive merge handoff. After
merge it marks the issue `verifying_on_main`, applies the `verifying-on-main` label,
pauses the work/planning agents, preserves workspace/state/vBRIEF/branches, and stops
Docker containers and networks.

Docker cleanup still happens at merge time because orphaned networks from merged
workspaces accumulate and eventually block new workspace creation with "all predefined
address pools have been fully subnetted". Docker's default pool only supports ~31 bridge
networks. NEVER remove this cleanup step.

The destructive/non-reversible completion steps are owned by close-out, not merge:
`pan close <id>` / dashboard Close Out completes the vBRIEF, archives planning artifacts,
optionally tears down the workspace or deletes feature branches according to `close_out`
config, closes the tracker issue, and clears review status.

## CRITICAL: Deep-Wipe Destroys Everything — NEVER Run Without Explicit User Confirmation

The deep-wipe endpoint (`POST /api/agents/:id/deep-wipe`) with `deleteWorkspace: true` is **irreversible** and destroys:

1. **tmux sessions** — all agent sessions killed
2. **Agent state directories** — `~/.panopticon/agents/<id>/` removed
3. **Entire workspace directory** — this includes:
   - `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` — the **workspace-specific vBRIEF plan**
   - `.beads/` — all task tracking beads
   - Any implementation work in progress
4. **Git branches** — both local AND remote `feature/<issue-id>` branches deleted
5. **Linear/GitHub status** — issue status reset to Todo/Open

**The scope vBRIEF** in `.pan/specs/` on main survives deep-wipe — it's committed to the project repo independently of the workspace. Project-level PRD archives (e.g., a team's own `docs/prds/` if they keep one for narrative archival) also survive; the Panopticon-managed PRD draft at `<projectRoot>/.pan/drafts/<issue>.md` survives too. The workspace `.pan/` directory (spec, continue state) and `.beads/` are destroyed.

**Rules:**
- **NEVER call deep-wipe programmatically** without the user explicitly requesting it
- **NEVER attempt destructive HTTP requests** (POST, DELETE) speculatively — HTTP requests execute immediately when sent; tool rejection by the user CANNOT stop an already-sent request
- When a user wants to restart an agent, use the regular stop/restart flow, NOT deep-wipe
- Deep-wipe is a last resort for cleaning up abandoned workspaces, not a routine operation

## TLDR: Token-Efficient Code Analysis

**If your workspace has a `.venv` directory, you have access to TLDR tools for code analysis.**

TLDR provides structured code summaries using 500-1,200 tokens per file instead of 10-25k, extending how much work you can accomplish per session.

### Available MCP Tools

When TLDR is available, you'll have these MCP tools:
- `tldr_context <file>` - File structure, exports, imports, key functions
- `tldr_structure <directory>` - Directory layout and relationships
- `tldr_calls <function> <file>` - Call graph (what calls this function)
- `tldr_impact <function> <file>` - Impact analysis (what this function calls)
- `tldr_semantic <query>` - Natural language code search

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Explore with TLDR first:**
   - Use `tldr_context` to understand file structure before reading
   - Use `tldr_semantic` to find relevant code by description
   - Use `tldr_calls` and `tldr_impact` for dependency analysis

2. **Read full files only when editing:**
   - TLDR shows you the structure and what to edit
   - Read the full file to get exact line numbers and implementation
   - Edit the specific sections you identified

3. **Avoid reading everything:**
   - 20 files × 15k tokens = 300k tokens (exhausts context)
   - 20 files × 800 tokens (TLDR) = 16k tokens (94% savings)

**Use TLDR liberally to maximize your session effectiveness.**

## Bash Output Compression (RTK)

When `agents.rtk.enabled` is true, Bash outputs the agent sees (git status, npm output, etc.) may be compressed by RTK. Re-run with `PANOPTICON_RTK_ENABLED=0` to regenerate raw command output.

### The four-artifact model (PAN-1124: single-spec-on-main)

There are four artifacts. They are distinct — do not conflate them.

| Artifact | Location | Writer | Mutability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PRD draft** (`.md`) | `<projectRoot>/.pan/drafts/<issue>.md` | Human or planning agent | Free-form narrative, human-mutable |
| **vBRIEF spec** (`.json`) on main | `<projectRoot>/.pan/specs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<ISSUE>-<slug>.vbrief.json` | Pipeline only (single writer) | Immutable after planning — only `plan.status` changes via `updateSpecStatus()` |
| **Project-side continue state** (`.json`) | `<projectRoot>/.pan/continues/<issue-lowercase>.vbrief.json` | Pipeline | Session resume point, decisions, hazards, sessionHistory, feedback — one canonical file per issue, never moves |
| **Workspace-side continue state** (`.json`) | `<workspace>/.pan/continue.json` | Pipeline + work agent | Session state + `statusOverrides` map tracking item/subItem completion |

**The PAN-1124 invariant — the spec on main is immutable after planning.** `findPlan()` resolves the main-side spec via `findSpecByIssue()`. `readWorkspacePlan()` returns a merged view: main spec + `statusOverrides` from workspace continue.json. `updateItemStatus()` and `updateSubItemStatus()` write ONLY to the workspace continue file's `statusOverrides` map — they cannot mutate the spec. The only legal spec mutation is `plan.status` via `updateSpecStatus()` in `pan-dir/specs.ts`. This replaces the old PAN-946 invariant (workspace-spec isolation) with a stronger guarantee: there is no workspace spec to isolate.

**Gitignore policy.** `.pan/continue.json` is listed in `.gitignore` and must NEVER be tracked in main. `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` may still exist in older workspaces (migration compat) but is no longer written by the pipeline. The lifecycle artifacts (`.pan/specs/`, `.pan/continues/`, `.pan/drafts/`) remain tracked — they're the canonical record of plans, continue states, and PRD drafts at rest.

### Status is a JSON field, not a directory

`plan.status` advances through one canonical file via atomic single-commit updates on main. Files do not move between directories.

```
draft (in .pan/drafts/*.md) ──► proposed ──► approved ──► active/running ──► completed
                                       │                                          │
                                       └──────────► cancelled ◄───────────────────┘
```

| Transition | Trigger | What changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (new) → draft | `pan plan` starts | Markdown PRD written to `<projectRoot>/.pan/drafts/<issue>.md` |
| draft → proposed | Planning completes | vBRIEF created in `<projectRoot>/.pan/specs/...` with `plan.status: "proposed"` |
| proposed → approved/running | `pan start` | Status field flipped on main; work agent reads spec from main via `findPlan()` |
| running → completed | PR merges | Status field flipped to `"completed"` on main |
| any → cancelled | Issue closed | Status field flipped to `"cancelled"` on main |

### Legacy paths

PAN-967 unified everything under `.pan/`. The following are gone or read-only legacy:

- `.planning/plan.vbrief.json` — **DELETED.** Replaced by `.pan/spec.vbrief.json`.
- `docs/prds/planned/`, `docs/prds/active/` — no longer a Panopticon convention. PRD drafts live in `.pan/drafts/`. Projects may keep their own `docs/prds/` for human archival, but Panopticon does not read or write it.
- `vbrief/{proposed,active,completed,cancelled}/` at the project root — still read by `findLegacyVBriefByIssue` for backward compatibility during migration; pipeline writes target `.pan/specs/` only. Legacy spec files (non-continue) remain at these paths as read-only fallback.

If you see an agent referencing `.planning/`, `docs/prds/planned/*.vbrief.json`, or planning a "copy PRD vBRIEF into workspace .planning" step, the agent is reading a pre-PAN-967 problem statement and needs to be redirected at `docs/VBRIEF.md`.

### Auto-Behaviors

- `io.ts` (`updateItemStatus`/`updateSubItemStatus`) write to workspace continue.json `statusOverrides` map — they do NOT mutate the spec.
- `readWorkspacePlan()` returns a merged view: main spec + `statusOverrides` overlay from workspace continue.json.
- `complete-planning` writes the vBRIEF to `<projectRoot>/.pan/specs/...` with `plan.status: "proposed"`.
- `start-agent` flips the main-side status field. Work agents read the spec from main via `findPlan()`.
- `postMergeLifecycle` marks merged work as `verifying_on_main` and preserves the vBRIEF in its running/active state.
- `closeOut` flips the main-side `plan.status` to `"completed"` after post-merge verification.
- `findPlan(workspacePath)` resolves main-side spec via `findSpecByIssue(projectRoot, issueId)`, with fallback to workspace-local `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` for migration compat.

### Dashboard Viewer

VBriefViewer components at `src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/vbrief/`:
- Accessible via **vBRIEF button** on kanban issue cards and InspectorPanel
- List / DAG / Raw JSON tabs
- Fetches from `GET /api/workspaces/:issueId/plan` (resolves from `.pan/specs/` on main via `findSpecByIssue`, with workspace fallback for migration compat)

## Issue Creation from PRDs

When creating a Linear or GitHub issue from a PRD, **always reference the PRD at the very top of the issue description** -- before any other content. Use a bold label with a repo-relative path and a clickable link:

```
**PRD:** [`path/to/prd.md`](https link to the file in the repo)
```

The issue body should then contain a tight summary (vision, motivation, design goals, key capabilities, phases) -- NOT a full copy of the PRD. The PRD is the source of truth for data models, architecture, code samples, and implementation details. Duplicating that content into the issue creates drift.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
