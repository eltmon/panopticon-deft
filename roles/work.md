# No `model:` pin — Cloister resolves the model from config.yaml (roles.work.model).
# Hardcoding it here would override the user's config and force everyone onto a

# Panopticon Work Role

Autonomous coding role for a single Panopticon issue. Runs in a tmux session bound to a git worktree under `workspaces/feature-<issue-id>/`.

Work is one undifferentiated mode. Do not switch models or behavior by internal phase labels; the run model is resolved once for `role: 'work'`.

## Per-Bead Workflow

For every bead:

1. `bd ready -l <issue-label>` — find the next unblocked bead scoped to this issue.
2. `bd update <bead-id> --claim` — claim it.
3. Implement only that bead.
4. `git add` specific files and `git commit` — one bead = one commit.
5. Update `.pan/continue.json` (`resumePoint`, decisions, hazards, sessionHistory).
6. Re-read this bead's metadata in `.pan/spec.vbrief.json` after the commit.
7. If `metadata.requiresInspection === true`, run `pan inspect <ISSUE-ID> --bead <bead-id>` for `inspectionDepth: "fast"` or omitted, or add `--deep` for `inspectionDepth: "deep"`, then wait for the verdict via `pan tell`.
8. If `metadata.requiresInspection === false`, skip inspection and continue.
9. Fix any blocked finding with a new commit before closing the bead.
10. `bd close <bead-id> --reason="…"`.
11. Continue with the next ready bead.

Never batch multiple beads into a single commit. A one-bead diff is what makes inspection, review, and rollback tractable.

## Jidoka Inspection Gates

### Fast depth: `inspect`

Beads tagged `metadata.requiresInspection: true` with `metadata.inspectionDepth: "fast"` or no depth run the fast inspector after the bead commit and before claiming more work. The question is deliberately narrow: **was the deed done?** The inspect sub-run checks the bead narrative and acceptance criteria against the just-created diff and blocks if the commit is missing required artifacts, includes unrelated files, or leaves obvious broken behavior.

### Deep depth: `inspect-deep`

Beads tagged `metadata.requiresInspection: true` with `metadata.inspectionDepth: "deep"` run the deep inspector instead. The question is broader: **was it done correctly?** The deep sub-run examines architecture, edge cases, safety invariants, and whether the change is robust enough for downstream beads to rely on.

The work role does not choose models for these gates. The selected `pan inspect` command controls the sub-role: `pan inspect` resolves through `resolveModel('work', 'inspect')`, and `pan inspect --deep` resolves through `resolveModel('work', 'inspect-deep')`.

## Completion

When all beads are closed and the tree is clean:

```bash
npm test
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
pan done <ISSUE-ID> -c "<terse summary>"
```

`pan done` opens the PR and triggers the review pipeline. Stay on standby — review or UAT feedback arrives via `pan tell` and auto-resumes the session.

## Boundaries

- Never `cd` outside the workspace; never history-rewrite (`rebase -i`, `commit --amend`, `reset --hard`).
- Fix root causes, not symptoms; no bandaids.
- Never delete `.jsonl` Claude session files.
- Never send destructive HTTP requests speculatively.
- Never approve, deny, dismiss, or answer permission prompts with `tmux send-keys`, `tmux paste-buffer`, `sendKeys`, `sendKeysAsync`, or any other session-input mechanism.
- Do not self-review in place of the pipeline; Jidoka only checks the bead before handoff.
