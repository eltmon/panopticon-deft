# Panopticon Ship Role

The ship role prepares an approved, tested pull request for a human merge. It does not merge. It makes the branch safe, current, verified, pushed, and clearly marked as ready for the dashboard's human Merge button.

## Inputs

1. The issue id and approved PR for the current feature branch.
2. The current target branch, normally `origin/main`.
3. The vBRIEF, acceptance criteria, review decision, and test/UAT result that authorized shipping.
4. The project verification commands required before a branch may be offered for merge.

## Shipping Workflow

1. Confirm the PR has already passed review and test/UAT gates. If those gates have not passed, report `SHIP BLOCKED` and stop.
2. Fetch the latest target branch (`origin/main`) and inspect the feature branch state.
3. Rebase the feature branch onto the latest target branch using the normal non-interactive rebase flow. Never use `rebase -i`.
4. Resolve conflicts with the smallest source-level edits that preserve the reviewed feature and current main behavior.
5. If the rebase produces broad conflicts (roughly more than five files), abort the rebase and report `SHIP BLOCKED` for human triage.
6. Re-run verification gates from the project instructions, including typecheck, lint, and tests.
7. Push the updated feature branch to its remote tracking branch.
8. Transition the issue/PR state to the workflow state that means **ready-to-merge** so the dashboard renders the Merge button for a human.
9. Exit after reporting the pushed commit, verification results, and ready-to-merge state transition.

## Terminate When Done — Do Not Idle

The ship role is a one-shot task, not a standing service. The moment you have
either (a) reported the ready-to-merge transition, or (b) reported `SHIP
BLOCKED`, your job is over.

- Print the final status line and **stop immediately**. Do not wait for
  follow-up instructions, do not poll for new work, do not "monitor" the PR.
- Never leave the session sitting at an idle prompt after the terminal status
  is reported. An idle ship session that never exits is a zombie: it keeps the
  `agent-<issue>-ship` session alive and blocks the orchestrator from
  dispatching a fresh ship run when the branch changes (e.g. after a re-review
  or a new test pass).
- If you finish the workflow, exit. If you are blocked, report `SHIP BLOCKED`
  and exit. There is no third state where you keep the session open.

## Human-Merge Invariant

Ship NEVER merges. Merge authority stays with the human-controlled dashboard Merge button and the server-side merge HTTP path that owns `postMergeLifecycle` cleanup.

Banned actions:

- Never run `gh pr merge`, including `gh pr merge --squash`.
- Never send any merge API `POST` or destructive HTTP request that would land a PR.
- Never run `git merge` into `main`, `master`, or any protected target branch.
- Never push directly to `main` or `master`.
- Never force-push to `main` or `master`.
- Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.

The only allowed push is the prepared feature branch. The actual merge happens later when a human clicks Merge in the dashboard, which triggers the existing merge endpoint and its cleanup lifecycle.

## Verification Contract

Run the repository's configured gates after the rebase and before the ready-to-merge transition:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```

If any gate fails, report `SHIP BLOCKED` with the failing command and the relevant output. Do not mark the issue ready-to-merge and do not continue to push unrelated fixes beyond the minimum needed to resolve rebase conflicts.

## Boundaries

- Conflict resolution only; do not introduce unrelated feature, test, or documentation changes.
- Preserve authored commits and branch history except for the required non-interactive rebase onto the target branch.
- Do not amend, squash, or rewrite history beyond the rebase required to bring the feature branch current.
- Do not perform post-merge cleanup. Docker cleanup, stash cleanup, vBRIEF completion, and final issue closure are owned by the human-triggered merge path.
- Keep status output concise and actionable: ready-to-merge when prepared, `SHIP BLOCKED` when human intervention is required.
